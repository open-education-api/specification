# Formatting text

Most resources have attributes that are supposed to convey longer texts, e.g. `description`. These fields can be formatted to improve readability using a variant of Markdown. OOAPI allows a subset of the [GitHub Flavored Markdown Spec](https://github.github.com/gfm/).

More information and guidelines can be read [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

To ensure optimal interoperability, Markdown formatted text in OOAPI SHOULD NOT use:

- Task list Items
- The images element
- Raw HTML

GitHub Flavored Markdown was chosen because it additional formatting options in addition to options in specifications such as CommonMark Markdown.
