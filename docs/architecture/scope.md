# OOAPI scope

The OOAPI specification is aimed at providing information related to student activities and the information need of students in general.

Examples of use of the OOAPI are:

* Detailed information on courses that are available at an institution on a shared website;
* Rostering information for a student on a student app;
* Results on courses on a student app;

The current implementation of OOAPI is aimed at data in transit. It provides information that is currently available and can be aggregated from within an educational institution. In the current iteration of the OOAPI we are not focussing on historical data nor versioning of a given data element.

Specifically for the RIO implementation historical data is now also being made available.

The current scope of the OOAPI plotted on the [HORA](https://www.surf.nl/hoger-onderwijs-referentie-architectuur-hora) information objects is shown in the figure below:
