    Security must be implemented at the level of the actual deployment rather than in the core specification. 
    This means that the specification remains neutral, while concrete security measures can be applied in practice 
    using established techniques such as OAuth flows with fine-grained definitions. For example, access may be 
    managed through the flow identified as nl-test-admin-flow-2-3-4. The previous inline declaration has therefore 
    been removed to avoid conflating implementation details with the specification.
