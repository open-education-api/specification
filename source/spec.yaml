    </figure>

    The model provides an overview of the educational domain that is modelled and
    forms the basis of the OOAPI. The overarching educational concept is not exposed
    through API endpoints. Instead, the educational specification defines four base
    objects: programme, course, learning component, and test component, each with
    its own endpoint.

    These base objects can be used to realise offerings. There is, however, no
    dedicated offering endpoint. Offerings are represented through four base
    types: programme offering, course offering, learning component offering, and
    test component offering.

    Relations between an offering and a person, such as enrolment, are realised
    through association endpoints. These endpoints define the different types of
    associations that can exist between offerings and persons. Other objects shown
    in the model represent groups and group memberships of a person.
    
    The original file for this model can be found <a target="_blank" href="ooapi_v6_latest.drawio">here</a>

    The programme relations object is not found as a separate endpoint but relations between programmes can be found within the programme endpoint by expanding that endpoint.

    Notes:
    - Cardinality notation: `Source : Target` where `*` = many (0 or more), `1` = exactly one, `0..1` = zero or one
    - Bidirectional relationships (↔) indicate many-to-many relationships that can be traversed in both directions
    - Some relationships are implemented through junction entities (e.g., Associations for enrolments)
    - The "offered as" relationships connect abstract educational entities to their concrete scheduled instances
    - Organisation acts as a central entity providing and managing most other entities in the system

  - name: course offering associations
    description: |
      The course offering associations API provides information about the association
      between a course offering and a person (e.g. students, lecturers, etc).
      Associations can be posted between institutions. This requires detailed information
      on the course offering and the persons. To allow for this information a
      complete person object and offering object can be part of the API. The structure
      is explained in the following model:
      <table>
        <tr>
         <td></td>
         <td colspan=3 align=center>offering</td>

  - name: data_model
    x-displayName: Data model
    description: |
      The Open Education API defines different objects using schemas.
      These schemas are based on OpenAPI base types, with occasional specific amendments to these base types.
      The types we use are:
        The data type of a schema is defined by the type keyword, for example, type: string. OpenAPI defines the following basic types:
        - [string](#strings) (this includes dates and files)
        - number
        - integer
        - boolean
        - array
        - [object](#objects)


      ### Strings

      A string of text is defined as:
      
      ```yaml  
      type: string
      String length can be restricted using minLength and maxLength:
      ```
      
      
      ```yaml
        type: string
        minLength: 3
        maxLength: 20
      ```

      Note that an empty string "" is a valid string unless minLength or pattern is specified.
      String Formats

      An optional format modifier can be used as a hint about the contents and structure of the string. OpenAPI defines the following built-in string formats:

      
      ```yaml  
      date – full-date notation as defined by RFC 3339, section 5.6, for example, 2017-07-21
      date-time – the date-time notation as defined by RFC 3339, section 5.6, for example, 2017-07-21T17:32:28+1:00
      byte – base64-encoded characters, for example, U3dhZ2dlciByb2Nrcw==
      binary – binary data, used to describe files
      ```

      ### Objects

      The Open Education API contains a set of predefined objects that are related to one another. 
      All objects listed below, and the relations between them are shown in the model at the top of this page.

  - name: group_model
    x-displayName: Group
    description: |
      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/Group" />

  - name: groups
    description: |
      The groups API provides information about groups that are related to
      organisations, persons and offerings. Groups of students that are related to an
      offering are typically used for rostering. The rostering application assigns
      students based on these groups. For example, class 1b will be assigned to the
      course offering on Monday morning. Not all groups are related to an offering. A
      group of people can also be a team that is working on a task outside the 
      scope of the OOAPI. These can be teams of students, but also teams of employees.

  - name: programme offering associations
    description: |
      The programme offering associations API provides information about the association
      between a programme offering and a person (e.g. students, lecturers, etc).
      Associations can be posted between institutions. This requires detailed information
      on the programme offering and the persons. To allow for this information a
      complete person object and offering object can be part of the API. The structure
      is explained in the following model:

          looking into a solution.

  - name: security
    description: |
      Within the specification, no global security is defined. This keeps the core
      specification neutral and avoids prescribing a single security model for all
      operations. For those API calls that require authentication or authorisation,
      this is explicitly indicated in the accompanying documentation.
      
      By leaving the global security section empty, implementation details are
      separated from the functional description, while still providing guidance on how
      concrete security measures can be applied in practice.
