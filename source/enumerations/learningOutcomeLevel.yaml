  The level of the learning outcome. This field supports multiple frameworks for
  describing cognitive complexity. Two common frameworks are provided below: **Bloom’s**
  and **SOLO**. These are intended as examples — additional levels or entirely
  different frameworks MAY be added as needed.

  **Bloom’s taxonomy** ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom's_taxonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom's_taxonomy)):

  | Level   | Label      | Description                                                         |
  |---------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | bloom_1 | Remember   | Recall facts and basic concepts (define, list, state).              |
  | bloom_2 | Understand | Explain ideas or concepts (describe, discuss, explain).             |
  | bloom_3 | Apply      | Use knowledge in new situations (implement, solve, use).            |
  | bloom_4 | Analyse    | Draw connections among ideas (differentiate, compare, examine).     |
  | bloom_5 | Evaluate   | Justify a decision or course of action (critique, assess, argue).   |
  | bloom_6 | Create     | Produce new or original work (design, construct, develop).          |

  **SOLO taxonomy** ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_of_observed_learning_outcome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_of_observed_learning_outcome)):

  | Level   | Label             | Description                                                     |
  |---------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
  | solo_0  | Prestructural     | No understanding; the student misses the point.                 |
  | solo_1  | Unistructural     | Identifies or carries out simple procedures; limited to one     |
  |         |                   | relevant aspect.                                                |
  | solo_2  | Multistructural   | Addresses several relevant aspects, but sees them as unrelated; |
  |         |                   | knowledge is additive.                                          |
  | solo_3  | Relational        | Integrates aspects into a coherent whole, showing deeper        |
  |         |                   | understanding of relationships.                                 |
  | solo_4  | Extended abstract | Generalises and applies learning to new domains, showing        |
  |         |                   | theoretical and abstract thinking.                              |

  This is an *extensible enumeration*. Implementers MAY introduce other recognised
  taxonomies, institutional or national frameworks.
