The overarching educational concept is not exposed\nthrough API endpoints. Instead, the educational specification defines four base\nobjects: programme, course, learning component, and test component, each with\nits own endpoint.\n\nThese base objects can be used to realise offerings. There is, however, no\ndedicated offering endpoint. Offerings are represented through four base\ntypes: programme offering, course offering, learning component offering, and\ntest component offering.\n\nRelations between an offering and a person, such as enrolment, are realised\nthrough association endpoints. These endpoints define the different types of\nassociations that can exist between offerings and persons. Other objects shown\nin the model represent groups and group memberships of a person.\n\nThe original file for this model can be found <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"ooapi_v6_latest.drawio\">here</a>\n\nThe programme relations object is not found as a separate endpoint but relations between programmes can be found within the programme endpoint by expanding that endpoint.\n\nDefinitions for all relationships in the model:\n\n| Entities

For example, write access \non course-offering associations for an external user (me.write) can be granted in this way.

For example, write access \non programme-offering associations for an external user (“me.write”) can be granted in this way.
