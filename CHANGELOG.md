- split person and associations into properties - ID and a aggragated person association object this allows for better reuse e.g. in POST where ID is not mandatory and in typed responses
- Renames the offering attribute `mainLanguage` to `teachingLanguage` and also adds it to all Programs, Courses and Components.
- Changed the enumeration for organizationTypes. Renamed `institution` to `institute` to prevent confusion with `root`. Added `branch`, `academy` and `school`.
- Changed postalType enumeration. Added `billing` address type
- Removed 404 responses for paths that return a collection.
- #157 removed `crohoCreboCode` from Program and `brin` from Organization. Use the new otherCode schema for this.
- Rename the `lengthOfProgram` attribute to `duration` and change the format to duration as described in RFC 3339.

- Removed the enums `alliance` and `joint-degree` from `programTypes`. These values described properties of programs that are independent of the type of the program. Therefore they have been removed.
- Split course requirements into admissionRequirements and qualificationRequirements

### Removed
- Removed the attribute `profileOfProgram` from Program, because it was effectively a duplicate of `description`.
