### Changed
- Improve error responses to make them more semantically correct (#158)
- Changed pagination for all responses returning a collection of items. Responses now include `hasNextPage`, `hasPreviousPage` and optional `totalPages` attributes. These additions make pagination easier for clients.
- Split person and associations into properties - ID and a aggregated person association object this allows for better reuse e.g. in POST where ID is not mandatory and in typed responses
- Renames the offering attribute `mainLanguage` to `teachingLanguage` and also adds it to all Programs, Courses and Components. `teachingLanguage` now only allows three-letter language codes as specified in ISO 639-2.
- Changed the enumeration for organizationTypes. Renamed `institution` to `institute` to prevent confusion with `root`. Added `branch`, `academy` and `school`.
- Changed postalType enumeration. Added `billing` and `teaching` address type
- Rename the `lengthOfProgram` attribute to `duration` and change the format to duration as described in RFC 3339.
- Changed object types from string to array: `Name`, `Description`, `learningOutcomes`, `admissionRequirements` and `qualificationRequirements`(if present) in Program, Course, Component, Offering and Organization. (#163)
- Removed the enums `alliance`, `elective`, `module` and `joint-degree` from `programTypes`. These values described properties of programs (or courses) that are independent of the type of the program. Therefore they have been removed.
- Split course requirements into admissionRequirements and qualificationRequirements
- Renamed option `year` of the AcademicSession `type` enumeration to `academicYear` to clarify what is meant.
- Renamed isLineItem to resultExpected to improve understandability of the specification
- Changed the `ects` attribute of an association result to `studyLoad`.

### Removed
- Removed the attribute `profileOfProgram` from Program, because it was effectively a duplicate of `description`.
- Removed 404 responses for paths that return a collection.
- Removed `crohoCreboCode` from Program and `brin` from Organization. Use the new otherCode schema for this. (#157)
- Removed the enums `alliance` and `joint-degree` from `programTypes`. These values described properties of programs that are independent of the type of the program. Therefore they have been removed.
- Removed the Accept-Language header from all requests. It is superseded by the new LanguageTypedStrings which always return text in all available languages.
- Removed the attribute `modeOfStudy` from ProgramOffering and CourseOffering.
- Removed option `term` of the AcademicSession `type` enumeration because term is a synonym for Academic session, so all sessions are terms.
