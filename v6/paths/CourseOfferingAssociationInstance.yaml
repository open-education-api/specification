patch:
  summary: PATCH /course-offering-associations/{courseOfferingAssociationId}
  operationId: partialUpdateCourseOfferingAssociationById
  description: |
    Update the status or result of an enrollment. Other elements of the association object COULD 
    also be PATCHED. But are not likely and have therefor not been included in this endpoint.
    Implementation of the PATCH activity is based on use PATCH with JSON Merge Patch standard, 
    a specialized media type `application/merge-patch+json` for partial resource representation 
    to update parts of resource objects.

    Security must be implemented at the level of the actual deployment rather than in the core 
    specification. This means that the specification remains neutral, while concrete security 
    measures can be applied in practice using established techniques such as OpenID with fine-grained 
    scopes. For example, write access on associations (associations.write) can be granted in this way. 
    The previous inline declaration has therefore been removed to avoid conflating implementation 
    details with the specification.
