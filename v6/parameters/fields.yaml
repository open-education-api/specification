description: |
  Allows clients to indicate which fields should be included in the response.  
  This parameter supports the principle of data minimisation and helps to optimise 
  data usage and performance by reducing unnecessary data transmission.

  The `fields` parameter uses *nested field selection syntax* with parentheses for subfields, 
  for example: `programme(code)` or `campus(city)`.  
  Multiple fields can be grouped within parentheses, for example:  
  `fields=(id,title,ectsCredits,programme(code),campus(city))`.

  When omitted, the server returns all fields the client has access to.  
  Unknown field names SHOULD be ignored.  
  The server SHOULD/MUST always include *mandatory fields* (e.g., identifiers such as `id`) 
  that are required for a valid or minimal response, even if not explicitly requested.

  *Important:* This is a **request hint**, not a **security feature**.  
  The server MAY disregard the request for a restricted set of fields, and the final response 
  structure MAY depend on server logic and the client’s access rights.


  If a client requests unauthorised fields, these MUST be silently omitted or redacted.
