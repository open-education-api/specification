description: >
  Comma-separated list of field names to exclude from the response.
  Use dot notation for nested fields (e.g., `assessment.details`, `contacts.email`).
  If both `fields` and `exclude_fields` are present, servers SHOULD apply `fields`
  first (whitelist), then remove any matches from `exclude_fields` (blacklist).
  Unknown fields SHOULD be ignored.
