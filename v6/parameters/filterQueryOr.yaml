  OR blocks. Provide an array of single-field filter objects, each combined with OR.
  Serialises as `filter_query[__or][][field][operation]=value`.

  Inspired by Storyblok (https://www.storyblok.com/docs/api/content-delivery/v2/filter-queries)

  Wildcards:
  - Prefer using only the asterisk `*` as a wildcard for partial matches (e.g., like).
  - Other wildcard characters (such as `%`) MUST be escaped and MAY NOT be supported by all implementations.

  Implementation note:
  - The availability and behaviour of this query functionality are entirely determined by the organisation hosting
    the API implementation. It is not mandatory for implementers to support this functionality, and it cannot be enforced 
    upon organisations that provide or consume OOAPI endpoints.
  - It is up to each implementer to decide whether to support this feature. It is **not** a requirement of the OOAPI 
    standard itself.
  - Consumers or working groups that wish to apply specific filtering mechanisms are encouraged to do so using 
    this approach for the sake of consistency across implementations.

  Examples:
  <ul style="list-style: none;padding-left: 1.2em; margin: 0;">
    <li>
 
      **Provider is Org A or Org B, OR campus city contains “Utrecht”** <br />
      `?filter_query[__or][][organisation.id][in]=org-uu,org-hku&filter_query[__or][][campus.city][like]=*Utrecht*`
    
      **Start date after 1 Sept 2025 OR has evening/block_week tag** <br />
      `?filter_query[__or][][start_date][gt_date]=2025-09-01T00:00:00Z&filter_query[__or][][tags][any_in_array]=evening,block_week`

    </li>
