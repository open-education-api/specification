    The model provides an overview of how the objects on which the API is specified are related. The overarching concept educations is not found in the in the end points of the API. The smaller concepts of programmeOffering, courseOffering and conceptOffering are all found in the offering endpoint. The different types of association can all be found in the association endpoint.
    
    The original file for this model can be found <a target="_blank" href="OOAPIv5_model_v0.5.drawio">here</a>

    The programme relations object is not found as a separate endpoint but relations between programmes can be found within the programme endpoint by expanding that endpoint.

    Definitions for all relationships in the model:

    Notes:
    - Cardinality notation: `Source : Target` where `*` = many (0 or more), `1` = exactly one, `0..1` = zero or one
    - Bidirectional relationships (↔) indicate many-to-many relationships that can be traversed in both directions
    - Some relationships are implemented through junction entities (e.g., Associations for enrollments)
    - The "offered as" relationships connect abstract educational entities to their concrete scheduled instances
    - Organization acts as a central entity providing and managing most other entities in the system

      The rooms API provides the part of a building where an activity can take place.
      Including detail information on the resources available, number of seats, etc.
      (Updated continuously)

  - name: security
    description: |
      Within the specification, no global security is defined. This keeps the core
      specification neutral and avoids prescribing a single security model for all
      operations. For those API calls that require authentication or authorisation,
      this is explicitly indicated in the accompanying documentation.
      
      By leaving the global security section empty, implementation details are
      separated from the functional description, while still providing guidance on how
      concrete security measures can be applied in practice.

  - name: service metadata

      The service API provides additional metadata needed to make the OOAPI fit for
      this organisation.
