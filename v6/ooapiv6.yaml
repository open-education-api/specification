  title: Open Education API
  description: "OpenAPI (fka Swagger) specification for the Open Education API. \n\nThe specification can be downloaded as a whole in <a href=\"./ooapiv6.yaml\" download>yaml</a>\nand in <a href=\"./ooapiv6.json\" download>json</a>\n\n<figure>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"ooapi_v6.png\">\n  <img src=\"ooapi_v6.png\" alt=\"OOAPI information model that feeds OOAPI specification\" width=\"100%\" class=\"img-responsive\">\n  </a>\n  <figcaption> OOAPI information model that feeds OOAPI specification (click to enlage)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe model provides an overview of the educational domain that is modelled and\nforms the basis of the OOAPI. The overarching educational concept is not exposed\nthrough API endpoints. Instead, the educational specification defines four base\nobjects: programme, course, learning component, and test component, each with\nits own endpoint.\n\nThese base objects can be used to realise offerings. There is, however, no\ndedicated offering endpoint. Offerings are represented through four base\ntypes: programme offering, course offering, learning component offering, and\ntest component offering.\n\nRelations between an offering and a person, such as enrolment, are realised\nthrough association endpoints. These endpoints define the different types of\nassociations that can exist between offerings and persons. Other objects shown\nin the model represent groups and group memberships of a person.\n\nThe original file for this model can be found <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"ooapi_v6_i7.drawio\">here</a>\n\nThe programme relations object is not found as a separate endpoint but relations between programmes can be found within the programme endpoint by expanding that endpoint.\n\nDefinitions for all relationships in the model:\n\n| Entities

    description: |
      The course offering associations API provides information about the association
      between a course offering and a person (e.g. students, lecturers, etc).
      Associations can be posted between institutions. This requires detailed information
      on the course offering and the persons. To allow for this information a
      complete person object and offering object can be part of the API. The structure
      is explained in the following model:
      <table>
        <tr>
         <td></td>
         <td colspan=3 align=center>offering</td>

  - name: data_model
    x-displayName: Data model
    description: |
      The Open Education API defines different objects using schemas.
      These schemas are based on OpenAPI base types, with occasional specific amendments to these base types.
      The types we use are:
        The data type of a schema is defined by the type keyword, for example, type: string. OpenAPI defines the following basic types:
        - [string](#strings) (this includes dates and files)
        - number
        - integer
        - boolean
        - array
        - [object](#objects)


      ### Strings

      A string of text is defined as:

      ```yaml  
      type: string
      String length can be restricted using minLength and maxLength:
      ```


      ```yaml
        type: string
        minLength: 3
        maxLength: 20
      ```

      Note that an empty string "" is a valid string unless minLength or pattern is specified.
      String Formats

      An optional format modifier can be used as a hint about the contents and structure of the string. OpenAPI defines the following built-in string formats:


      ```yaml  
      date – full-date notation as defined by RFC 3339, section 5.6, for example, 2017-07-21
      date-time – the date-time notation as defined by RFC 3339, section 5.6, for example, 2017-07-21T17:32:28+1:00
      byte – base64-encoded characters, for example, U3dhZ2dlciByb2Nrcw==
      binary – binary data, used to describe files
      ```

      ### Objects

      The Open Education API contains a set of predefined objects that are related to one another. 
      All objects listed below, and the relations between them are shown in the model at the top of this page.

  - name: group_model
    x-displayName: Group
    description: |
      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/Group" />
  - name: groups
    description: |
      The groups API provides information about groups that are related to
      organisations, persons and offerings. Groups of students that are related to an
      offering are typically used for rostering. The rostering application assigns
      students based on these groups. For example, class 1b will be assigned to the
      course offering on Monday morning. Not all groups are related to an offering. A
      group of people can also be a team that is working on a task outside the 
      scope of the OOAPI. These can be teams of students, but also teams of employees.

          This method is not yet implemented it requires full student details and
          offering details. This would mean the OOAPI message would contain more than
          one resource in the message. At the moment the student mobility project is
          looking into a solution.
          <br> Alternatively it could be achieved through using two calls:
          <ul>
           <li>create student with POST
               <a href="#tag/persons/paths/~1persons~1{personId}/post">/persons</a>

               <a href="#tag/offerings/paths/~1offerings~1{offeringId}~1associations~1external/post">
               /offerings/{offeringId}/associations/me</a>
           </li>
          </ul>
          for the enrolment
         </td>
          -->
         <td>no support needed</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      Direct update of current information: <a
        href="#tag/programme-offering-associations/operation/partialUpdateProgrammeOfferingAssociationById">
        PATCH /programme-offering-associations/{programmeOfferingAssociationId}</a>
      This call is currently limited to passing results and a remote state. For future
      use other association resource information could be passed. More information on
      the support for student mobility can be found

  - name: security
    description: |
      Within the specification, no global security is defined. This keeps the core
      specification neutral and avoids prescribing a single security model for all
      operations. For those API calls that require authentication or authorisation,
      this is explicitly indicated in the accompanying documentation.

      By leaving the global security section empty, implementation details are
      separated from the functional description, while still providing guidance on how
      concrete security measures can be applied in practice.

          description: |
            Not Acceptable.

            Returned when the server cannot produce a representation in the
            requested OOAPI or consumer version. The server may serve the
            requested version or any lower compatible minor version.

            If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is
            available, a 406 response is returned to indicate that no acceptable
            representation can be produced.

            This behaviour slightly deviates from strict HTTP semantics. Although
            no HTTP Accept header is used, the server performs an internal
            Accept-like version check after the HTTP layer, and returns 406 to
            signal that the requested representation cannot be provided.

            This approach improves clarity, implementation consistency and
            debugging, because the requested and supported versions are explicit
            in both the request and the 406 response, avoiding ambiguity caused
            by full HTTP content negotiation or Accept-based parsing.

            It also improves logging. Servers can log the requested and supported
            versions at the point of mismatch, allowing operators to detect
            outdated consumers, configuration issues or unexpected version drift.

            Wildcards:
            - Prefer using only the asterisk `*` as a wildcard for partial matches (e.g., like).

            Implementation note:
            - The availability and behaviour of this query functionality are entirely determined by the organisation hosting
              the API implementation. It is not mandatory for implementers to support this functionality, and it cannot be enforced 
              upon organisations that provide or consume OOAPI endpoints.
            - It is up to each implementer to decide whether to support this feature. It is **not** a requirement of the OOAPI 
              standard itself.
            - Consumers or working groups that wish to apply specific filtering mechanisms are encouraged to do so using 
              this approach for the sake of consistency across implementations.

            Examples:  
              - **Provider is Org A or Org B, OR campus city contains “Utrecht”**  
                `?filter_query[__or][][organisation.id][in]=org-uu,org-hku&filter_query[__or][][campus.city][like]=*Utrecht*`

            Allows clients to indicate which fields should be included in the response.  
            This parameter supports the principle of data minimisation and helps to optimise 
            data usage and performance by reducing unnecessary data transmission.

            The `fields` parameter uses *nested field selection syntax* with parentheses for subfields, 
            for example: `programme(code)` or `campus(city)`.  
            Multiple fields can be grouped within parentheses, for example:  
            `fields=(id,title,ectsCredits,programme(code),campus(city))`.

            When omitted, the server returns all fields the client has access to.  
            Unknown field names SHOULD be ignored.  
            The server MUST always include *mandatory fields* (e.g., identifiers such as `id`) 
            that are required for a valid or minimal response, even if not explicitly requested.

            *Important:* This is a **request hint**, not a **security feature**.  
            The server MAY disregard the request for a restricted set of fields, and the final response 
            structure MAY depend on server logic and the client’s access rights.


            If a client requests unauthorised fields, these MUST be silently omitted or redacted.

                                      RFC 4647 supports language specifications from very general to very specific. 
                                      This breaks down as:
                                      - ([a-z]{2,3}) - Primary language subtag (2-3 letters) ISO 639-1, ISO 639-2, or ISO 639-3 https://www.iso.org/iso-639-language-code
                                      - (-([A-Z]{2}|[0-9]{3}))? - Optional region/country (2 uppercase letters or 3 digits) ISO 3166-1 or UN M.49 https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html
                                      - (-([a-z]{4}))? - Optional script subtag (4 lowercase letters)
                                      - (-([a-z]{2}|[0-9]{3}))* - Optional variant subtags
                                      - (-[a-z0-9]{2,8})* - Optional extension subtags
                                      - (-x(-[a-z0-9]{1,8})+)? - Optional private use extensions

                                      When using this schema, the most common format is a two-letter language code as specified by ISO 639-1, optionally followed by a dash and a two-letter country code as specified by ISO 3166-1 (e.g. "en" or "en-GB").
                                      More specific language tags are also allowed, such as "zh-Hant-TW" for Traditional Chinese as used in Taiwan.
                                      For sign language based on a certain language two methods are commonly used: either using the subtag "sgn" (e.g. "nl-sgn-NL" for Dutch Sign Language) or using the subtag "s" (e.g. "nl-s-NL" for Dutch Sign Language). Both methods are allowed.

            cannot be located. This applies to instance endpoints where a single,
            uniquely-addressable object is expected.  

            Collection endpoints should not return a 404. If no items match the request,
            they must return an empty array. A 404 may still occur if the collection
            endpoint itself does not exist or is not accessible.

            Not Acceptable.

            Returned when the server cannot produce a representation in the
            requested OOAPI or consumer version. The server may serve the
            requested version or any lower compatible minor version.

            If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is
            available, a 406 response is returned to indicate that no acceptable
            representation can be produced.

            This behaviour slightly deviates from strict HTTP semantics. Although
            no HTTP Accept header is used, the server performs an internal
            Accept-like version check after the HTTP layer, and returns 406 to
            signal that the requested representation cannot be provided.

            This approach improves clarity, implementation consistency and
            debugging, because the requested and supported versions are explicit
            in both the request and the 406 response, avoiding ambiguity caused
            by full HTTP content negotiation or Accept-based parsing.

            It also improves logging. Servers can log the requested and supported
            versions at the point of mismatch, allowing operators to detect
            outdated consumers, configuration issues or unexpected version drift.

            Allows clients to indicate which fields should be included in the response.  
            This parameter supports the principle of data minimisation and helps to optimise 
            data usage and performance by reducing unnecessary data transmission.

            The `fields` parameter uses *nested field selection syntax* with parentheses for subfields, 
            for example: `programme(code)` or `campus(city)`.  
            Multiple fields can be grouped within parentheses, for example:  
            `fields=(id,title,ectsCredits,programme(code),campus(city))`.

            When omitted, the server returns all fields the client has access to.  
            Unknown field names SHOULD be ignored.  
            The server MUST always include *mandatory fields* (e.g., identifiers such as `id`) 
            that are required for a valid or minimal response, even if not explicitly requested.

            *Important:* This is a **request hint**, not a **security feature**.  
            The server MAY disregard the request for a restricted set of fields, and the final response 
            structure MAY depend on server logic and the client’s access rights.


            If a client requests unauthorised fields, these MUST be silently omitted or redacted.

            Returned only when a specific resource identified by its identifier
            cannot be located. This applies to instance endpoints where a single,
            uniquely-addressable object is expected.  

            Collection endpoints should not return a 404. If no items match the request,
            they must return an empty array. A 404 may still occur if the collection
            endpoint itself does not exist or is not accessible.

            Returned when the server cannot produce a representation in the
            requested OOAPI or consumer version. The server may serve the
            requested version or any lower compatible minor version.

            If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is
            available, a 406 response is returned to indicate that no acceptable
            representation can be produced.

            This behaviour slightly deviates from strict HTTP semantics. Although
            no HTTP Accept header is used, the server performs an internal
            Accept-like version check after the HTTP layer, and returns 406 to
            signal that the requested representation cannot be provided.

            This approach improves clarity, implementation consistency and
            debugging, because the requested and supported versions are explicit
            in both the request and the 406 response, avoiding ambiguity caused
            by full HTTP content negotiation or Accept-based parsing.

            It also improves logging. Servers can log the requested and supported
            versions at the point of mismatch, allowing operators to detect
            outdated consumers, configuration issues or unexpected version drift.

            Allows clients to indicate which fields should be included in the response.  
            This parameter supports the principle of data minimisation and helps to optimise 
            data usage and performance by reducing unnecessary data transmission.

            The `fields` parameter uses *nested field selection syntax* with parentheses for subfields, 
            for example: `programme(code)` or `campus(city)`.  
            Multiple fields can be grouped within parentheses, for example:  
            `fields=(id,title,ectsCredits,programme(code),campus(city))`.

            When omitted, the server returns all fields the client has access to.  
            Unknown field names SHOULD be ignored.  
            The server MUST always include *mandatory fields* (e.g., identifiers such as `id`) 
            that are required for a valid or minimal response, even if not explicitly requested.

            *Important:* This is a **request hint**, not a **security feature**.  
            The server MAY disregard the request for a restricted set of fields, and the final response 
            structure MAY depend on server logic and the client’s access rights.


            If a client requests unauthorised fields, these MUST be silently omitted or redacted.

                                    RFC 4647 supports language specifications from very general to very specific. 
                                    This breaks down as:
                                    - ([a-z]{2,3}) - Primary language subtag (2-3 letters) ISO 639-1, ISO 639-2, or ISO 639-3 https://www.iso.org/iso-639-language-code
                                    - (-([A-Z]{2}|[0-9]{3}))? - Optional region/country (2 uppercase letters or 3 digits) ISO 3166-1 or UN M.49 https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html
                                    - (-([a-z]{4}))? - Optional script subtag (4 lowercase letters)
                                    - (-([a-z]{2}|[0-9]{3}))* - Optional variant subtags
                                    - (-[a-z0-9]{2,8})* - Optional extension subtags
                                    - (-x(-[a-z0-9]{1,8})+)? - Optional private use extensions

                                    When using this schema, the most common format is a two-letter language code as specified by ISO 639-1, optionally followed by a dash and a two-letter country code as specified by ISO 3166-1 (e.g. "en" or "en-GB").
                                    More specific language tags are also allowed, such as "zh-Hant-TW" for Traditional Chinese as used in Taiwan.
                                    For sign language based on a certain language two methods are commonly used: either using the subtag "sgn" (e.g. "nl-sgn-NL" for Dutch Sign Language) or using the subtag "s" (e.g. "nl-s-NL" for Dutch Sign Language). Both methods are allowed.

                                    A supplementary content item consists of a technical media form (`type`),
                                    a semantic purpose (`role`), and an array of `value` entries. Together these
                                    fields define both how the content MUST be interpreted (`type`) and why it
                                    is provided (`role`).

                                    The `type` specifies the underlying media form (text, image, video or http)
                                    and determines how each `value` item MUST be handled. The `role` describes
                                    the intent or purpose of the supplementary item (for example announcement,
                                    badge, marketing or promotional teaser) and MUST NOT duplicate or encode
                                    the media form defined by `type`.

                                    The separation between `type` and `role` ensures that the same media form
                                    can serve multiple purposes, and that the semantic meaning remains
                                    independent from the technical representation of the content. The `value`
                                    array contains one or more language-typed strings, allowing the same content
                                    item to be expressed in multiple languages or alternative textual variants.

                                        The fundamental semantic purpose of the supplementary content. The selected
                                        `role` describes the intent or function of the item (for example, badge,
                                        teaser or promotional highlight).

                                        The `role` MUST NOT duplicate or encode the technical media form defined by
                                        `type`. The `type` specifies the underlying media form (such as text, image,
                                        video or http), whereas the `role` clarifies how that media is intended to be
                                        interpreted or used.

                                        determines how the associated `value` MUST be interpreted. It defines the
                                        technical representation of the content, independent of its semantic role.

                                        The `type` specifies the underlying media form, such as text_plain,
                                        text_md, text_http, image, video or uri.

                                        The `role` defines the semantic intent of the item and MUST NOT duplicate the
                                        technical media form defined by `type`.

                                                value: As with all empirical sciences, to assure valid outcomes, HCI studies heavily rely on research methods and statistics. This holds for the design of user interfaces, personalized recommender systems, and interaction paradigms for the internet of things. This course prepares you to do so by learning you to collect data, design experiments, and analyse the results. By the end of the course, you will have a detailed understanding of how to select and apply quantitative research methods and analysis to address virtually all HCI challenges. Quantitative research and data analysis will be taught in the context of state-of-the-art HCI challenges. Lectures will be alternated with hands-on learning, including work with predefined datasets (e.g., addressing facial features, cognitive load, and emotion). Additionally, students will set up their own research (e.g., using eye tracking). Data processing and analysis will be executed using R.

                                                RFC 4647 supports language specifications from very general to very specific. 
                                                This breaks down as:
                                                - ([a-z]{2,3}) - Primary language subtag (2-3 letters) ISO 639-1, ISO 639-2, or ISO 639-3 https://www.iso.org/iso-639-language-code
                                                - (-([A-Z]{2}|[0-9]{3}))? - Optional region/country (2 uppercase letters or 3 digits) ISO 3166-1 or UN M.49 https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html
                                                - (-([a-z]{4}))? - Optional script subtag (4 lowercase letters)
                                                - (-([a-z]{2}|[0-9]{3}))* - Optional variant subtags
                                                - (-[a-z0-9]{2,8})* - Optional extension subtags
                                                - (-x(-[a-z0-9]{1,8})+)? - Optional private use extensions

                                                When using this schema, the most common format is a two-letter language code as specified by ISO 639-1, optionally followed by a dash and a two-letter country code as specified by ISO 3166-1 (e.g. "en" or "en-GB").
                                                More specific language tags are also allowed, such as "zh-Hant-TW" for Traditional Chinese as used in Taiwan.
                                                For sign language based on a certain language two methods are commonly used: either using the subtag "sgn" (e.g. "nl-sgn-NL" for Dutch Sign Language) or using the subtag "s" (e.g. "nl-s-NL" for Dutch Sign Language). Both methods are allowed.

                                              ISCED-F categorizes the fields of study 2 digits at root level and further subdivision as more digits are added.
                                              Preferably fieldsOfStudy contains at least 4 digits.
                                              ISCEDF2013vSOI2021 currently allows for 6 digits max (https://www.cbs.nl/-/media/cbs/onze-diensten/methoden/classificaties/documents/2025/pubsoi2021_ed2425.pdf).

                                                          RFC 4647 supports language specifications from very general to very specific. 
                                                          This breaks down as:

                                                          When using this schema, the most common format is a two-letter language code as specified by ISO 639-1, optionally followed by a dash and a two-letter country code as specified by ISO 3166-1 (e.g. "en" or "en-GB").
                                                          More specific language tags are also allowed, such as "zh-Hant-TW" for Traditional Chinese as used in Taiwan.
                                                          For sign language based on a certain language two methods are commonly used: either using the subtag "sgn" (e.g. "nl-sgn-NL" for Dutch Sign Language) or using the subtag "s" (e.g. "nl-s-NL" for Dutch Sign Language). Both methods are allowed.

            Returned only when a specific resource identified by its identifier
            cannot be located. This applies to instance endpoints where a single,
            uniquely-addressable object is expected.  

            Collection endpoints should not return a 404. If no items match the request,
            they must return an empty array. A 404 may still occur if the collection
            endpoint itself does not exist or is not accessible.

            Returned when the server cannot produce a representation in the
            requested OOAPI or consumer version. The server may serve the
            requested version or any lower compatible minor version.

            If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is
            available, a 406 response is returned to indicate that no acceptable
            representation can be produced.

            This behaviour slightly deviates from strict HTTP semantics. Although
            no HTTP Accept header is used, the server performs an internal
            Accept-like version check after the HTTP layer, and returns 406 to
            signal that the requested representation cannot be provided.

            This approach improves clarity, implementation consistency and
            debugging, because the requested and supported versions are explicit
            in both the request and the 406 response, avoiding ambiguity caused
            by full HTTP content negotiation or Accept-based parsing.

            It also improves logging. Servers can log the requested and supported
            versions at the point of mismatch, allowing operators to detect
            outdated consumers, configuration issues or unexpected version drift.

            Wildcards:
            - Prefer using only the asterisk `*` as a wildcard for partial matches (e.g., like and not_like).

            Implementation note:
            - The availability and behaviour of this query functionality are entirely determined by the organisation hosting
              the API implementation. It is not mandatory for implementers to support this functionality, and it cannot be enforced 
              upon organisations that provide or consume OOAPI endpoints.
            - It is up to each implementer to decide whether to support this feature. It is **not** a requirement of the OOAPI 
              standard itself.
            - Consumers or working groups that wish to apply specific filtering mechanisms are encouraged to do so using 
              this approach for the sake of consistency across implementations.

            Wildcards:
            - Prefer using only the asterisk `*` as a wildcard for partial matches (e.g., like).

            Implementation note:
            - The availability and behaviour of this query functionality are entirely determined by the organisation hosting
              the API implementation. It is not mandatory for implementers to support this functionality, and it cannot be enforced 
              upon organisations that provide or consume OOAPI endpoints.
            - It is up to each implementer to decide whether to support this feature. It is **not** a requirement of the OOAPI 
              standard itself.
            - Consumers or working groups that wish to apply specific filtering mechanisms are encouraged to do so using 
              this approach for the sake of consistency across implementations.

            Examples:  
              - **Provider is Org A or Org B, OR campus city contains “Utrecht”**  
                `?filter_query[__or][][organisation.id][in]=org-uu,org-hku&filter_query[__or][][campus.city][like]=*Utrecht*`

            Allows clients to indicate which fields should be included in the response.  
            This parameter supports the principle of data minimisation and helps to optimise 
            data usage and performance by reducing unnecessary data transmission.

            The `fields` parameter uses *nested field selection syntax* with parentheses for subfields, 
            for example: `programme(code)` or `campus(city)`.  
            Multiple fields can be grouped within parentheses, for example:  
            `fields=(id,title,ectsCredits,programme(code),campus(city))`.

            When omitted, the server returns all fields the client has access to.  
            Unknown field names SHOULD be ignored.  
            The server MUST always include *mandatory fields* (e.g., identifiers such as `id`) 
            that are required for a valid or minimal response, even if not explicitly requested.

            *Important:* This is a **request hint**, not a **security feature**.  
            The server MAY disregard the request for a restricted set of fields, and the final response 
            structure MAY depend on server logic and the client’s access rights.


            If a client requests unauthorised fields, these MUST be silently omitted or redacted.

                                            This implies one learningComponent of type lecture with seven learningComponentOfferings of type lecture.

                                              When using this schema, the most common format is a two-letter language code as specified by ISO 639-1, optionally followed by a dash and a two-letter country code as specified by ISO 3166-1 (e.g. "en" or "en-GB").
                                              More specific language tags are also allowed, such as "zh-Hant-TW" for Traditional Chinese as used in Taiwan.
                                              For sign language based on a certain language two methods are commonly used: either using the subtag "sgn" (e.g. "nl-sgn-NL" for Dutch Sign Language) or using the subtag "s" (e.g. "nl-s-NL" for Dutch Sign Language). Both methods are allowed.

            Returned only when a specific resource identified by its identifier
            cannot be located. This applies to instance endpoints where a single,
            uniquely-addressable object is expected.  

            Collection endpoints should not return a 404. If no items match the request,
            they must return an empty array. A 404 may still occur if the collection
            endpoint itself does not exist or is not accessible.

            Returned when the server cannot produce a representation in the
            requested OOAPI or consumer version. The server may serve the
            requested version or any lower compatible minor version.

            If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is
            available, a 406 response is returned to indicate that no acceptable
            representation can be produced.

            This behaviour slightly deviates from strict HTTP semantics. Although
            no HTTP Accept header is used, the server performs an internal
            Accept-like version check after the HTTP layer, and returns 406 to
            signal that the requested representation cannot be provided.

            This approach improves clarity, implementation consistency and
            debugging, because the requested and supported versions are explicit
            in both the request and the 406 response, avoiding ambiguity caused
            by full HTTP content negotiation or Accept-based parsing.

            It also improves logging. Servers can log the requested and supported
            versions at the point of mismatch, allowing operators to detect
            outdated consumers, configuration issues or unexpected version drift.

            Allows clients to indicate which fields should be included in the response.  
            This parameter supports the principle of data minimisation and helps to optimise 
            data usage and performance by reducing unnecessary data transmission.

            The `fields` parameter uses *nested field selection syntax* with parentheses for subfields, 
            for example: `programme(code)` or `campus(city)`.  
            Multiple fields can be grouped within parentheses, for example:  
            `fields=(id,title,ectsCredits,programme(code),campus(city))`.

            When omitted, the server returns all fields the client has access to.  
            Unknown field names SHOULD be ignored.  
            The server MUST always include *mandatory fields* (e.g., identifiers such as `id`) 
            that are required for a valid or minimal response, even if not explicitly requested.

            *Important:* This is a **request hint**, not a **security feature**.  
            The server MAY disregard the request for a restricted set of fields, and the final response 
            structure MAY depend on server logic and the client’s access rights.


            If a client requests unauthorised fields, these MUST be silently omitted or redacted.

            Not Found.  

            Returned only when a specific resource identified by its identifier
            cannot be located. This applies to instance endpoints where a single,
            uniquely-addressable object is expected.  

            Collection endpoints should not return a 404. If no items match the request,
            they must return an empty array. A 404 may still occur if the collection
            endpoint itself does not exist or is not accessible.

            Not Acceptable.

            Returned when the server cannot produce a representation in the
            requested OOAPI or consumer version. The server may serve the
            requested version or any lower compatible minor version.

            If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is
            available, a 406 response is returned to indicate that no acceptable
            representation can be produced.

            This behaviour slightly deviates from strict HTTP semantics. Although
            no HTTP Accept header is used, the server performs an internal
            Accept-like version check after the HTTP layer, and returns 406 to
            signal that the requested representation cannot be provided.

            This approach improves clarity, implementation consistency and
            debugging, because the requested and supported versions are explicit
            in both the request and the 406 response, avoiding ambiguity caused
            by full HTTP content negotiation or Accept-based parsing.

            It also improves logging. Servers can log the requested and supported
            versions at the point of mismatch, allowing operators to detect
            outdated consumers, configuration issues or unexpected version drift.

            Allows clients to indicate which fields should be included in the response.  
            This parameter supports the principle of data minimisation and helps to optimise 
            data usage and performance by reducing unnecessary data transmission.

            The `fields` parameter uses *nested field selection syntax* with parentheses for subfields, 
            for example: `programme(code)` or `campus(city)`.  
            Multiple fields can be grouped within parentheses, for example:  
            `fields=(id,title,ectsCredits,programme(code),campus(city))`.

            When omitted, the server returns all fields the client has access to.  
            Unknown field names SHOULD be ignored.  
            The server MUST always include *mandatory fields* (e.g., identifiers such as `id`) 
            that are required for a valid or minimal response, even if not explicitly requested.

            *Important:* This is a **request hint**, not a **security feature**.  
            The server MAY disregard the request for a restricted set of fields, and the final response 
            structure MAY depend on server logic and the client’s access rights.


            If a client requests unauthorised fields, these MUST be silently omitted or redacted.

                                              RFC 4647 supports language specifications from very general to very specific. 
                                              This breaks down as:
                                              - ([a-z]{2,3}) - Primary language subtag (2-3 letters) ISO 639-1, ISO 639-2, or ISO 639-3 https://www.iso.org/iso-639-language-code
                                              - (-([A-Z]{2}|[0-9]{3}))? - Optional region/country (2 uppercase letters or 3 digits) ISO 3166-1 or UN M.49 https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html
                                              - (-([a-z]{4}))? - Optional script subtag (4 lowercase letters)
                                              - (-([a-z]{2}|[0-9]{3}))* - Optional variant subtags

                                              When using this schema, the most common format is a two-letter language code as specified by ISO 639-1, optionally followed by a dash and a two-letter country code as specified by ISO 3166-1 (e.g. "en" or "en-GB").
                                              More specific language tags are also allowed, such as "zh-Hant-TW" for Traditional Chinese as used in Taiwan.
                                              For sign language based on a certain language two methods are commonly used: either using the subtag "sgn" (e.g. "nl-sgn-NL" for Dutch Sign Language) or using the subtag "s" (e.g. "nl-s-NL" for Dutch Sign Language). Both methods are allowed.

            Returned when the server cannot produce a representation in the
            requested OOAPI or consumer version. The server may serve the
            requested version or any lower compatible minor version.

            If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is
            available, a 406 response is returned to indicate that no acceptable
            representation can be produced.

            This behaviour slightly deviates from strict HTTP semantics. Although
            no HTTP Accept header is used, the server performs an internal
            Accept-like version check after the HTTP layer, and returns 406 to
            signal that the requested representation cannot be provided.

            This approach improves clarity, implementation consistency and
            debugging, because the requested and supported versions are explicit
            in both the request and the 406 response, avoiding ambiguity caused
            by full HTTP content negotiation or Accept-based parsing.

            It also improves logging. Servers can log the requested and supported
            versions at the point of mismatch, allowing operators to detect
            outdated consumers, configuration issues or unexpected version drift.

            Allows clients to indicate which fields should be included in the response.  
            This parameter supports the principle of data minimisation and helps to optimise 
            data usage and performance by reducing unnecessary data transmission.

            The `fields` parameter uses *nested field selection syntax* with parentheses for subfields, 
            for example: `programme(code)` or `campus(city)`.  
            Multiple fields can be grouped within parentheses, for example:  
            `fields=(id,title,ectsCredits,programme(code),campus(city))`.

            When omitted, the server returns all fields the client has access to.  
            Unknown field names SHOULD be ignored.  
            The server MUST always include *mandatory fields* (e.g., identifiers such as `id`) 
            that are required for a valid or minimal response, even if not explicitly requested.

            *Important:* This is a **request hint**, not a **security feature**.  
            The server MAY disregard the request for a restricted set of fields, and the final response 
            structure MAY depend on server logic and the client’s access rights.


            If a client requests unauthorised fields, these MUST be silently omitted or redacted.

            `fields=(id,title,ectsCredits,programme(code),campus(city))`.

            When omitted, the server returns all fields the client has access to.  
            Unknown field names SHOULD be ignored.  
            The server MUST always include *mandatory fields* (e.g., identifiers such as `id`) 
            that are required for a valid or minimal response, even if not explicitly requested.

            *Important:* This is a **request hint**, not a **security feature**.

            cannot be located. This applies to instance endpoints where a single,
            uniquely-addressable object is expected.  

            Collection endpoints should not return a 404. If no items match the request,
            they must return an empty array. A 404 may still occur if the collection
            endpoint itself does not exist or is not accessible.

            Returned when the server cannot produce a representation in the
            requested OOAPI or consumer version. The server may serve the
            requested version or any lower compatible minor version.

            If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is
            available, a 406 response is returned to indicate that no acceptable
            representation can be produced.

            This behaviour slightly deviates from strict HTTP semantics. Although
            no HTTP Accept header is used, the server performs an internal
            Accept-like version check after the HTTP layer, and returns 406 to
            signal that the requested representation cannot be provided.

            This approach improves clarity, implementation consistency and
            debugging, because the requested and supported versions are explicit
            in both the request and the 406 response, avoiding ambiguity caused
            by full HTTP content negotiation or Accept-based parsing.

            It also improves logging. Servers can log the requested and supported
            versions at the point of mismatch, allowing operators to detect
            outdated consumers, configuration issues or unexpected version drift.

        The offering can either be identified by an offeringId if known or the full offering details. 

        Security must be implemented at the level of the actual deployment rather than in the core specification. 
        This means that the specification remains neutral, while concrete security measures can be applied in 
        practice using established techniques such as OpenID with fine-grained scopes. For example, write access 
        on course-offering associations for an external user (me.write) can be granted in this way. The previous 
        inline declaration has therefore been removed to avoid conflating implementation details with the 
        specification.

            Returned only when a specific resource identified by its identifier
            cannot be located. This applies to instance endpoints where a single,
            uniquely-addressable object is expected.  

            Collection endpoints should not return a 404. If no items match the request,
            they must return an empty array. A 404 may still occur if the collection
            endpoint itself does not exist or is not accessible.

            Not Acceptable.

            Returned when the server cannot produce a representation in the
            requested OOAPI or consumer version. The server may serve the
            requested version or any lower compatible minor version.

            If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is
            available, a 406 response is returned to indicate that no acceptable
            representation can be produced.

            This behaviour slightly deviates from strict HTTP semantics. Although
            no HTTP Accept header is used, the server performs an internal
            Accept-like version check after the HTTP layer, and returns 406 to
            signal that the requested representation cannot be provided.

            This approach improves clarity, implementation consistency and
            debugging, because the requested and supported versions are explicit
            in both the request and the 406 response, avoiding ambiguity caused
            by full HTTP content negotiation or Accept-based parsing.

            It also improves logging. Servers can log the requested and supported
            versions at the point of mismatch, allowing operators to detect
            outdated consumers, configuration issues or unexpected version drift.

            Allows clients to indicate which fields should be included in the response.  
            This parameter supports the principle of data minimisation and helps to optimise 
            data usage and performance by reducing unnecessary data transmission.

            The `fields` parameter uses *nested field selection syntax* with parentheses for subfields, 
            for example: `programme(code)` or `campus(city)`.  
            Multiple fields can be grouped within parentheses, for example:  
            `fields=(id,title,ectsCredits,programme(code),campus(city))`.

            When omitted, the server returns all fields the client has access to.  
            Unknown field names SHOULD be ignored.  
            The server MUST always include *mandatory fields* (e.g., identifiers such as `id`) 
            that are required for a valid or minimal response, even if not explicitly requested.

            *Important:* This is a **request hint**, not a **security feature**.  
            The server MAY disregard the request for a restricted set of fields, and the final response 
            structure MAY depend on server logic and the client’s access rights.


            If a client requests unauthorised fields, these MUST be silently omitted or redacted.

            Returned when the server cannot produce a representation in the
            requested OOAPI or consumer version. The server may serve the
            requested version or any lower compatible minor version.

            If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is
            available, a 406 response is returned to indicate that no acceptable
            representation can be produced.

            This behaviour slightly deviates from strict HTTP semantics. Although
            no HTTP Accept header is used, the server performs an internal
            Accept-like version check after the HTTP layer, and returns 406 to
            signal that the requested representation cannot be provided.

            This approach improves clarity, implementation consistency and
            debugging, because the requested and supported versions are explicit
            in both the request and the 406 response, avoiding ambiguity caused
            by full HTTP content negotiation or Accept-based parsing.

            It also improves logging. Servers can log the requested and supported
            versions at the point of mismatch, allowing operators to detect
            outdated consumers, configuration issues or unexpected version drift.

      description: |
        Update the status or result of an enrolment. Other elements of the association object COULD 
        also be PATCHED. But are not likely and have therefore not been included in this endpoint.
        Implementation of the PATCH activity is based on use PATCH with JSON Merge Patch standard, 
        a specialized media type `application/merge-patch+json` for partial resource representation 
        to update parts of resource objects.

        Security must be implemented at the level of the actual deployment rather than in the core 
        specification. This means that the specification remains neutral, while concrete security 
        measures can be applied in practice using established techniques such as OpenID with fine-grained 
        scopes. For example, write access on associations (associations.write) can be granted in this way. 
        The previous inline declaration has therefore been removed to avoid conflating implementation 
        details with the specification.

            Allows clients to indicate which fields should be included in the response.  
            This parameter supports the principle of data minimisation and helps to optimise 
            data usage and performance by reducing unnecessary data transmission.

            The `fields` parameter uses *nested field selection syntax* with parentheses for subfields, 
            for example: `programme(code)` or `campus(city)`.  
            Multiple fields can be grouped within parentheses, for example:  
            `fields=(id,title,ectsCredits,programme(code),campus(city))`.

            When omitted, the server returns all fields the client has access to.  
            Unknown field names SHOULD be ignored.  
            The server MUST always include *mandatory fields* (e.g., identifiers such as `id`) 
            that are required for a valid or minimal response, even if not explicitly requested.

            *Important:* This is a **request hint**, not a **security feature**.  
            The server MAY disregard the request for a restricted set of fields, and the final response 
            structure MAY depend on server logic and the client’s access rights.


            If a client requests unauthorised fields, these MUST be silently omitted or redacted.

            cannot be located. This applies to instance endpoints where a single,
            uniquely-addressable object is expected.  

            Collection endpoints should not return a 404. If no items match the request,
            they must return an empty array. A 404 may still occur if the collection
            endpoint itself does not exist or is not accessible.

            Not Acceptable.

            Returned when the server cannot produce a representation in the
            requested OOAPI or consumer version. The server may serve the
            requested version or any lower compatible minor version.

            If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is
            available, a 406 response is returned to indicate that no acceptable
            representation can be produced.

            This behaviour slightly deviates from strict HTTP semantics. Although
            no HTTP Accept header is used, the server performs an internal
            Accept-like version check after the HTTP layer, and returns 406 to
            signal that the requested representation cannot be provided.

            This approach improves clarity, implementation consistency and
            debugging, because the requested and supported versions are explicit
            in both the request and the 406 response, avoiding ambiguity caused
            by full HTTP content negotiation or Accept-based parsing.

            It also improves logging. Servers can log the requested and supported
            versions at the point of mismatch, allowing operators to detect
            outdated consumers, configuration issues or unexpected version drift.

            Returned only when a specific resource identified by its identifier
            cannot be located. This applies to instance endpoints where a single,
            uniquely-addressable object is expected.  

            Collection endpoints should not return a 404. If no items match the request,
            they must return an empty array. A 404 may still occur if the collection
            endpoint itself does not exist or is not accessible.

            Not Acceptable.

            Returned when the server cannot produce a representation in the
            requested OOAPI or consumer version. The server may serve the
            requested version or any lower compatible minor version.

            If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is
            available, a 406 response is returned to indicate that no acceptable
            representation can be produced.

            This behaviour slightly deviates from strict HTTP semantics. Although
            no HTTP Accept header is used, the server performs an internal
            Accept-like version check after the HTTP layer, and returns 406 to
            signal that the requested representation cannot be provided.

            This approach improves clarity, implementation consistency and
            debugging, because the requested and supported versions are explicit
            in both the request and the 406 response, avoiding ambiguity caused
            by full HTTP content negotiation or Accept-based parsing.

            It also improves logging. Servers can log the requested and supported
            versions at the point of mismatch, allowing operators to detect
            outdated consumers, configuration issues or unexpected version drift.

            Allows clients to indicate which fields should be included in the response.  
            This parameter supports the principle of data minimisation and helps to optimise 
            data usage and performance by reducing unnecessary data transmission.

            The `fields` parameter uses *nested field selection syntax* with parentheses for subfields, 
            for example: `programme(code)` or `campus(city)`.  
            Multiple fields can be grouped within parentheses, for example:  
            `fields=(id,title,ectsCredits,programme(code),campus(city))`.

            When omitted, the server returns all fields the client has access to.  
            Unknown field names SHOULD be ignored.  
            The server MUST always include *mandatory fields* (e.g., identifiers such as `id`) 
            that are required for a valid or minimal response, even if not explicitly requested.

            *Important:* This is a **request hint**, not a **security feature**.  
            The server MAY disregard the request for a restricted set of fields, and the final response 
            structure MAY depend on server logic and the client’s access rights.


            If a client requests unauthorised fields, these MUST be silently omitted or redacted.

            Returned only when a specific resource identified by its identifier
            cannot be located. This applies to instance endpoints where a single,
            uniquely-addressable object is expected.  

            Collection endpoints should not return a 404. If no items match the request,
            they must return an empty array. A 404 may still occur if the collection
            endpoint itself does not exist or is not accessible.

            Not Acceptable.

            Returned when the server cannot produce a representation in the
            requested OOAPI or consumer version. The server may serve the
            requested version or any lower compatible minor version.

            If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is
            available, a 406 response is returned to indicate that no acceptable
            representation can be produced.

            This behaviour slightly deviates from strict HTTP semantics. Although
            no HTTP Accept header is used, the server performs an internal
            Accept-like version check after the HTTP layer, and returns 406 to
            signal that the requested representation cannot be provided.

            This approach improves clarity, implementation consistency and
            debugging, because the requested and supported versions are explicit
            in both the request and the 406 response, avoiding ambiguity caused
            by full HTTP content negotiation or Accept-based parsing.

            It also improves logging. Servers can log the requested and supported
            versions at the point of mismatch, allowing operators to detect
            outdated consumers, configuration issues or unexpected version drift.

            Wildcards:
            - Prefer using only the asterisk `*` as a wildcard for partial matches (e.g., like and not_like).

            Implementation note:
            - The availability and behaviour of this query functionality are entirely determined by the organisation hosting
              the API implementation. It is not mandatory for implementers to support this functionality, and it cannot be enforced 
              upon organisations that provide or consume OOAPI endpoints.
            - It is up to each implementer to decide whether to support this feature. It is **not** a requirement of the OOAPI 
              standard itself.
            - Consumers or working groups that wish to apply specific filtering mechanisms are encouraged to do so using 
              this approach for the sake of consistency across implementations.

            Implementation note:
            - The availability and behaviour of this query functionality are entirely determined by the organisation hosting
              the API implementation. It is not mandatory for implementers to support this functionality, and it cannot be enforced 
              upon organisations that provide or consume OOAPI endpoints.
            - It is up to each implementer to decide whether to support this feature. It is **not** a requirement of the OOAPI 
              standard itself.
            - Consumers or working groups that wish to apply specific filtering mechanisms are encouraged to do so using 
              this approach for the sake of consistency across implementations.

            Returned only when a specific resource identified by its identifier
            cannot be located. This applies to instance endpoints where a single,
            uniquely-addressable object is expected.  

            Collection endpoints should not return a 404. If no items match the request,
            they must return an empty array. A 404 may still occur if the collection
            endpoint itself does not exist or is not accessible.

            Returned when the server cannot produce a representation in the
            requested OOAPI or consumer version. The server may serve the
            requested version or any lower compatible minor version.

            If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is
            available, a 406 response is returned to indicate that no acceptable
            representation can be produced.

            This behaviour slightly deviates from strict HTTP semantics. Although
            no HTTP Accept header is used, the server performs an internal
            Accept-like version check after the HTTP layer, and returns 406 to
            signal that the requested representation cannot be provided.

            This approach improves clarity, implementation consistency and
            debugging, because the requested and supported versions are explicit
            in both the request and the 406 response, avoiding ambiguity caused
            by full HTTP content negotiation or Accept-based parsing.

            It also improves logging. Servers can log the requested and supported
            versions at the point of mismatch, allowing operators to detect
            outdated consumers, configuration issues or unexpected version drift.

            Wildcards:
            - Prefer using only the asterisk `*` as a wildcard for partial matches (e.g., like).

            Implementation note:
            - The availability and behaviour of this query functionality are entirely determined by the organisation hosting
              the API implementation. It is not mandatory for implementers to support this functionality, and it cannot be enforced 
              upon organisations that provide or consume OOAPI endpoints.
            - It is up to each implementer to decide whether to support this feature. It is **not** a requirement of the OOAPI 
              standard itself.
            - Consumers or working groups that wish to apply specific filtering mechanisms are encouraged to do so using 
              this approach for the sake of consistency across implementations.

            Examples:  
              - **Provider is Org A or Org B, OR campus city contains “Utrecht”**  
                `?filter_query[__or][][organisation.id][in]=org-uu,org-hku&filter_query[__or][][campus.city][like]=*Utrecht*`

            Allows clients to indicate which fields should be included in the response.  
            This parameter supports the principle of data minimisation and helps to optimise 
            data usage and performance by reducing unnecessary data transmission.

            The `fields` parameter uses *nested field selection syntax* with parentheses for subfields, 
            for example: `programme(code)` or `campus(city)`.  
            Multiple fields can be grouped within parentheses, for example:  
            `fields=(id,title,ectsCredits,programme(code),campus(city))`.

            When omitted, the server returns all fields the client has access to.  
            Unknown field names SHOULD be ignored.  
            The server MUST always include *mandatory fields* (e.g., identifiers such as `id`) 
            that are required for a valid or minimal response, even if not explicitly requested.

            *Important:* This is a **request hint**, not a **security feature**.  
            The server MAY disregard the request for a restricted set of fields, and the final response 
            structure MAY depend on server logic and the client’s access rights.


            If a client requests unauthorised fields, these MUST be silently omitted or redacted.

            Returned only when a specific resource identified by its identifier
            cannot be located. This applies to instance endpoints where a single,
            uniquely-addressable object is expected.  

            Collection endpoints should not return a 404. If no items match the request,
            they must return an empty array. A 404 may still occur if the collection
            endpoint itself does not exist or is not accessible.

        '406':

            Not Acceptable.

            Returned when the server cannot produce a representation in the
            requested OOAPI or consumer version. The server may serve the
            requested version or any lower compatible minor version.

            If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is
            available, a 406 response is returned to indicate that no acceptable
            representation can be produced.

            This behaviour slightly deviates from strict HTTP semantics. Although
            no HTTP Accept header is used, the server performs an internal
            Accept-like version check after the HTTP layer, and returns 406 to
            signal that the requested representation cannot be provided.

            This approach improves clarity, implementation consistency and
            debugging, because the requested and supported versions are explicit
            in both the request and the 406 response, avoiding ambiguity caused
            by full HTTP content negotiation or Accept-based parsing.

            It also improves logging. Servers can log the requested and supported
            versions at the point of mismatch, allowing operators to detect
            outdated consumers, configuration issues or unexpected version drift.

            available, a 406 response is returned to indicate that no acceptable

            This approach improves clarity, implementation consistency and
            debugging, because the requested and supported versions are explicit
            in both the request and the 406 response, avoiding ambiguity caused
            by full HTTP content negotiation or Accept-based parsing.

            It also improves logging. Servers can log the requested and supported
            versions at the point of mismatch, allowing operators to detect
            outdated consumers, configuration issues or unexpected version drift.

            Allows clients to indicate which fields should be included in the response.  
            This parameter supports the principle of data minimisation and helps to optimise 
            data usage and performance by reducing unnecessary data transmission.

            The `fields` parameter uses *nested field selection syntax* with parentheses for subfields, 
            for example: `programme(code)` or `campus(city)`.  
            Multiple fields can be grouped within parentheses, for example:  
            `fields=(id,title,ectsCredits,programme(code),campus(city))`.

            When omitted, the server returns all fields the client has access to.  
            Unknown field names SHOULD be ignored.  
            The server MUST always include *mandatory fields* (e.g., identifiers such as `id`) 
            that are required for a valid or minimal response, even if not explicitly requested.

            *Important:* This is a **request hint**, not a **security feature**.  
            The server MAY disregard the request for a restricted set of fields, and the final response 
            structure MAY depend on server logic and the client’s access rights.


            If a client requests unauthorised fields, these MUST be silently omitted or redacted.

            Allows clients to indicate which fields should be included in the response.  
            This parameter supports the principle of data minimisation and helps to optimise 
            data usage and performance by reducing unnecessary data transmission.

            The `fields` parameter uses *nested field selection syntax* with parentheses for subfields, 
            for example: `programme(code)` or `campus(city)`.  
            Multiple fields can be grouped within parentheses, for example:  
            `fields=(id,title,ectsCredits,programme(code),campus(city))`.

            When omitted, the server returns all fields the client has access to.  
            Unknown field names SHOULD be ignored.  
            The server MUST always include *mandatory fields* (e.g., identifiers such as `id`) 
            that are required for a valid or minimal response, even if not explicitly requested.

            *Important:* This is a **request hint**, not a **security feature**.  
            The server MAY disregard the request for a restricted set of fields, and the final response 
            structure MAY depend on server logic and the client’s access rights.


            If a client requests unauthorised fields, these MUST be silently omitted or redacted.

            cannot be located. This applies to instance endpoints where a single,

            Collection endpoints should not return a 404. If no items match the request,
            they must return an empty array. A 404 may still occur if the collection
            endpoint itself does not exist or is not accessible.

            Returned when the server cannot produce a representation in the
            requested OOAPI or consumer version. The server may serve the
            requested version or any lower compatible minor version.

            If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is
            available, a 406 response is returned to indicate that no acceptable
            representation can be produced.

            This behaviour slightly deviates from strict HTTP semantics. Although
            no HTTP Accept header is used, the server performs an internal
            Accept-like version check after the HTTP layer, and returns 406 to
            signal that the requested representation cannot be provided.

            This approach improves clarity, implementation consistency and
            debugging, because the requested and supported versions are explicit
            in both the request and the 406 response, avoiding ambiguity caused
            by full HTTP content negotiation or Accept-based parsing.

            It also improves logging. Servers can log the requested and supported
            versions at the point of mismatch, allowing operators to detect
            outdated consumers, configuration issues or unexpected version drift.

            Allows clients to indicate which fields should be included in the response.  
            This parameter supports the principle of data minimisation and helps to optimise 
            data usage and performance by reducing unnecessary data transmission.

            The `fields` parameter uses *nested field selection syntax* with parentheses for subfields, 
            for example: `programme(code)` or `campus(city)`.  
            Multiple fields can be grouped within parentheses, for example:  
            `fields=(id,title,ectsCredits,programme(code),campus(city))`.

            When omitted, the server returns all fields the client has access to.  
            Unknown field names SHOULD be ignored.  
            The server MUST always include *mandatory fields* (e.g., identifiers such as `id`) 
            that are required for a valid or minimal response, even if not explicitly requested.

            *Important:* This is a **request hint**, not a **security feature**.  
            The server MAY disregard the request for a restricted set of fields, and the final response 
            structure MAY depend on server logic and the client’s access rights.


            If a client requests unauthorised fields, these MUST be silently omitted or redacted.

            Collection endpoints should not return a 404. If no items match the request,
            they must return an empty array. A 404 may still occur if the collection

            Returned when the server cannot produce a representation in the
            requested OOAPI or consumer version. The server may serve the
            requested version or any lower compatible minor version.

            If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is
            available, a 406 response is returned to indicate that no acceptable
            representation can be produced.

            This behaviour slightly deviates from strict HTTP semantics. Although
            no HTTP Accept header is used, the server performs an internal
            Accept-like version check after the HTTP layer, and returns 406 to
            signal that the requested representation cannot be provided.

            This approach improves clarity, implementation consistency and
            debugging, because the requested and supported versions are explicit
            in both the request and the 406 response, avoiding ambiguity caused

            It also improves logging. Servers can log the requested and supported
            versions at the point of mismatch, allowing operators to detect
            outdated consumers, configuration issues or unexpected version drift.

            This parameter supports the principle of data minimisation and helps to optimise 
            data usage and performance by reducing unnecessary data transmission.

            The `fields` parameter uses *nested field selection syntax* with parentheses for subfields, 
            for example: `programme(code)` or `campus(city)`.  
            Multiple fields can be grouped within parentheses, for example:  
            `fields=(id,title,ectsCredits,programme(code),campus(city))`.

            When omitted, the server returns all fields the client has access to.  
            Unknown field names SHOULD be ignored.  
            The server MUST always include *mandatory fields* (e.g., identifiers such as `id`) 
            that are required for a valid or minimal response, even if not explicitly requested.

            *Important:* This is a **request hint**, not a **security feature**.  
            The server MAY disregard the request for a restricted set of fields, and the final response 
            structure MAY depend on server logic and the client’s access rights.


            If a client requests unauthorised fields, these MUST be silently omitted or redacted.

            uniquely-addressable object is expected.  

            Collection endpoints should not return a 404. If no items match the request,
            they must return an empty array. A 404 may still occur if the collection
            endpoint itself does not exist or is not accessible.

            Returned when the server cannot produce a representation in the
            requested OOAPI or consumer version. The server may serve the
            requested version or any lower compatible minor version.

            If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is
            available, a 406 response is returned to indicate that no acceptable
            representation can be produced.

            This behaviour slightly deviates from strict HTTP semantics. Although
            no HTTP Accept header is used, the server performs an internal
            Accept-like version check after the HTTP layer, and returns 406 to
            signal that the requested representation cannot be provided.

            This approach improves clarity, implementation consistency and
            debugging, because the requested and supported versions are explicit
            in both the request and the 406 response, avoiding ambiguity caused
            by full HTTP content negotiation or Accept-based parsing.

            It also improves logging. Servers can log the requested and supported
            versions at the point of mismatch, allowing operators to detect
            outdated consumers, configuration issues or unexpected version drift.

        Security must be implemented at the level of the actual deployment rather than in the core specification. 
        This means that the specification remains neutral, while concrete security measures can be applied in practice 
        using established techniques such as OAuth flows with fine-grained definitions. For example, access may be 
        managed through the flow identified as nl-test-admin-flow-2-3-4. The previous inline declaration has therefore 
        been removed to avoid conflating implementation details with the specification.

            Returned when the server cannot produce a representation in the
            requested OOAPI or consumer version. The server may serve the
            requested version or any lower compatible minor version.

            If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is
            available, a 406 response is returned to indicate that no acceptable
            representation can be produced.

            This behaviour slightly deviates from strict HTTP semantics. Although
            no HTTP Accept header is used, the server performs an internal
            Accept-like version check after the HTTP layer, and returns 406 to
            signal that the requested representation cannot be provided.

            This approach improves clarity, implementation consistency and
            debugging, because the requested and supported versions are explicit
            in both the request and the 406 response, avoiding ambiguity caused
            by full HTTP content negotiation or Accept-based parsing.

            It also improves logging. Servers can log the requested and supported
            versions at the point of mismatch, allowing operators to detect
            outdated consumers, configuration issues or unexpected version drift.

            *Important:* This is a **request hint**, not a **security feature**.  
            The server MAY disregard the request for a restricted set of fields, and the final response 
            structure MAY depend on server logic and the client’s access rights.

            cannot be located. This applies to instance endpoints where a single,
            uniquely-addressable object is expected.  

            Collection endpoints should not return a 404. If no items match the request,
            they must return an empty array. A 404 may still occur if the collection
            endpoint itself does not exist or is not accessible.

            Returned when the server cannot produce a representation in the
            requested OOAPI or consumer version. The server may serve the
            requested version or any lower compatible minor version.

            If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is
            available, a 406 response is returned to indicate that no acceptable
            representation can be produced.

            This behaviour slightly deviates from strict HTTP semantics. Although
            no HTTP Accept header is used, the server performs an internal
            Accept-like version check after the HTTP layer, and returns 406 to
            signal that the requested representation cannot be provided.

            This approach improves clarity, implementation consistency and
            debugging, because the requested and supported versions are explicit
            in both the request and the 406 response, avoiding ambiguity caused
            by full HTTP content negotiation or Accept-based parsing.

            It also improves logging. Servers can log the requested and supported
            versions at the point of mismatch, allowing operators to detect
            outdated consumers, configuration issues or unexpected version drift.

            Allows clients to indicate which fields should be included in the response.  
            This parameter supports the principle of data minimisation and helps to optimise 
            data usage and performance by reducing unnecessary data transmission.

            The `fields` parameter uses *nested field selection syntax* with parentheses for subfields, 
            for example: `programme(code)` or `campus(city)`.  
            Multiple fields can be grouped within parentheses, for example:  
            `fields=(id,title,ectsCredits,programme(code),campus(city))`.

            When omitted, the server returns all fields the client has access to.  
            Unknown field names SHOULD be ignored.  
            The server MUST always include *mandatory fields* (e.g., identifiers such as `id`) 
            that are required for a valid or minimal response, even if not explicitly requested.

            *Important:* This is a **request hint**, not a **security feature**.  
            The server MAY disregard the request for a restricted set of fields, and the final response 
            structure MAY depend on server logic and the client’s access rights.


            If a client requests unauthorised fields, these MUST be silently omitted or redacted.

        '406':

            Not Acceptable.

            Returned when the server cannot produce a representation in the
            requested OOAPI or consumer version. The server may serve the
            requested version or any lower compatible minor version.

            If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is
            available, a 406 response is returned to indicate that no acceptable
            representation can be produced.

            This behaviour slightly deviates from strict HTTP semantics. Although
            no HTTP Accept header is used, the server performs an internal
            Accept-like version check after the HTTP layer, and returns 406 to
            signal that the requested representation cannot be provided.

            This approach improves clarity, implementation consistency and
            debugging, because the requested and supported versions are explicit
            in both the request and the 406 response, avoiding ambiguity caused
            by full HTTP content negotiation or Accept-based parsing.

            It also improves logging. Servers can log the requested and supported
            versions at the point of mismatch, allowing operators to detect
            outdated consumers, configuration issues or unexpected version drift.

      description: |
        Update the status or result of an enrolment. Other elements of the association object COULD 
        also be PATCHED. But are not likely and have therefore not been included in this endpoint.
        Implementation of the PATCH activity is based on use PATCH with JSON Merge Patch standard, 
        a specialized media type `application/merge-patch+json` for partial resource representation 
        to update parts of resource objects.

        Security must be implemented at the level of the actual deployment rather than in the core 
        specification. This means that the specification remains neutral, while concrete security 
        measures can be applied in practice using established techniques such as OpenID with fine-grained 
        scopes (for example, write access on associations). The previous inline declaration has therefore
        been removed to avoid conflating implementation details with the specification.

            cannot be located. This applies to instance endpoints where a single,
            uniquely-addressable object is expected.  

            Collection endpoints should not return a 404. If no items match the request,
            they must return an empty array. A 404 may still occur if the collection
            endpoint itself does not exist or is not accessible.

            Returned when the server cannot produce a representation in the
            requested OOAPI or consumer version. The server may serve the
            requested version or any lower compatible minor version.

            If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is
            available, a 406 response is returned to indicate that no acceptable
            representation can be produced.

            This behaviour slightly deviates from strict HTTP semantics. Although
            no HTTP Accept header is used, the server performs an internal
            Accept-like version check after the HTTP layer, and returns 406 to
            signal that the requested representation cannot be provided.

            This approach improves clarity, implementation consistency and
            debugging, because the requested and supported versions are explicit
            in both the request and the 406 response, avoiding ambiguity caused
            by full HTTP content negotiation or Accept-based parsing.

            It also improves logging. Servers can log the requested and supported
            versions at the point of mismatch, allowing operators to detect
            outdated consumers, configuration issues or unexpected version drift.

            Allows clients to indicate which fields should be included in the response.  
            This parameter supports the principle of data minimisation and helps to optimise 
            data usage and performance by reducing unnecessary data transmission.

            The `fields` parameter uses *nested field selection syntax* with parentheses for subfields, 
            for example: `programme(code)` or `campus(city)`.  
            Multiple fields can be grouped within parentheses, for example:  
            `fields=(id,title,ectsCredits,programme(code),campus(city))`.

            When omitted, the server returns all fields the client has access to.  
            Unknown field names SHOULD be ignored.  
            The server MUST always include *mandatory fields* (e.g., identifiers such as `id`) 
            that are required for a valid or minimal response, even if not explicitly requested.

            *Important:* This is a **request hint**, not a **security feature**.  
            The server MAY disregard the request for a restricted set of fields, and the final response 
            structure MAY depend on server logic and the client’s access rights.


            If a client requests unauthorised fields, these MUST be silently omitted or redacted.

            Allows clients to indicate which fields should be included in the response.  
            This parameter supports the principle of data minimisation and helps to optimise 
            data usage and performance by reducing unnecessary data transmission.

            The `fields` parameter uses *nested field selection syntax* with parentheses for subfields, 
            for example: `programme(code)` or `campus(city)`.  
            Multiple fields can be grouped within parentheses, for example:  
            `fields=(id,title,ectsCredits,programme(code),campus(city))`.

            When omitted, the server returns all fields the client has access to.  
            Unknown field names SHOULD be ignored.  
            The server MUST always include *mandatory fields* (e.g., identifiers such as `id`) 
            that are required for a valid or minimal response, even if not explicitly requested.

            *Important:* This is a **request hint**, not a **security feature**.  
            The server MAY disregard the request for a restricted set of fields, and the final response 
            structure MAY depend on server logic and the client’s access rights.


            If a client requests unauthorised fields, these MUST be silently omitted or redacted.

            cannot be located. This applies to instance endpoints where a single,
            uniquely-addressable object is expected.  

            Collection endpoints should not return a 404. If no items match the request,
            they must return an empty array. A 404 may still occur if the collection
            endpoint itself does not exist or is not accessible.

            Returned when the server cannot produce a representation in the
            requested OOAPI or consumer version. The server may serve the
            requested version or any lower compatible minor version.

            If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is
            available, a 406 response is returned to indicate that no acceptable
            representation can be produced.

            This behaviour slightly deviates from strict HTTP semantics. Although
            no HTTP Accept header is used, the server performs an internal
            Accept-like version check after the HTTP layer, and returns 406 to
            signal that the requested representation cannot be provided.

            This approach improves clarity, implementation consistency and
            debugging, because the requested and supported versions are explicit
            in both the request and the 406 response, avoiding ambiguity caused
            by full HTTP content negotiation or Accept-based parsing.

            It also improves logging. Servers can log the requested and supported
            versions at the point of mismatch, allowing operators to detect
            outdated consumers, configuration issues or unexpected version drift.

            Allows clients to indicate which fields should be included in the response.  
            This parameter supports the principle of data minimisation and helps to optimise 
            data usage and performance by reducing unnecessary data transmission.

            The `fields` parameter uses *nested field selection syntax* with parentheses for subfields, 
            for example: `programme(code)` or `campus(city)`.  
            Multiple fields can be grouped within parentheses, for example:  
            `fields=(id,title,ectsCredits,programme(code),campus(city))`.

            When omitted, the server returns all fields the client has access to.  
            Unknown field names SHOULD be ignored.  
            The server MUST always include *mandatory fields* (e.g., identifiers such as `id`) 
            that are required for a valid or minimal response, even if not explicitly requested.

            *Important:* This is a **request hint**, not a **security feature**.  
            The server MAY disregard the request for a restricted set of fields, and the final response 
            structure MAY depend on server logic and the client’s access rights.


            If a client requests unauthorised fields, these MUST be silently omitted or redacted.

            Returned only when a specific resource identified by its identifier
            cannot be located. This applies to instance endpoints where a single,
            uniquely-addressable object is expected.  

            Collection endpoints should not return a 404. If no items match the request,
            they must return an empty array. A 404 may still occur if the collection
            endpoint itself does not exist or is not accessible.

            Not Acceptable.

            Returned when the server cannot produce a representation in the
            requested OOAPI or consumer version. The server may serve the
            requested version or any lower compatible minor version.

            If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is
            available, a 406 response is returned to indicate that no acceptable
            representation can be produced.

            This behaviour slightly deviates from strict HTTP semantics. Although
            no HTTP Accept header is used, the server performs an internal
            Accept-like version check after the HTTP layer, and returns 406 to
            signal that the requested representation cannot be provided.

            This approach improves clarity, implementation consistency and
            debugging, because the requested and supported versions are explicit
            in both the request and the 406 response, avoiding ambiguity caused
            by full HTTP content negotiation or Accept-based parsing.

            It also improves logging. Servers can log the requested and supported
            versions at the point of mismatch, allowing operators to detect
            outdated consumers, configuration issues or unexpected version drift.

            Allows clients to indicate which fields should be included in the response.  
            This parameter supports the principle of data minimisation and helps to optimise 
            data usage and performance by reducing unnecessary data transmission.

            The `fields` parameter uses *nested field selection syntax* with parentheses for subfields, 
            for example: `programme(code)` or `campus(city)`.  
            Multiple fields can be grouped within parentheses, for example:  
            `fields=(id,title,ectsCredits,programme(code),campus(city))`.

            When omitted, the server returns all fields the client has access to.  
            Unknown field names SHOULD be ignored.  
            The server MUST always include *mandatory fields* (e.g., identifiers such as `id`) 
            that are required for a valid or minimal response, even if not explicitly requested.

            *Important:* This is a **request hint**, not a **security feature**.  
            The server MAY disregard the request for a restricted set of fields, and the final response 
            structure MAY depend on server logic and the client’s access rights.


            If a client requests unauthorised fields, these MUST be silently omitted or redacted.

            Returned when the server cannot produce a representation in the
            requested OOAPI or consumer version. The server may serve the
            requested version or any lower compatible minor version.

            If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is
            available, a 406 response is returned to indicate that no acceptable
            representation can be produced.

            This behaviour slightly deviates from strict HTTP semantics. Although

            Returned when the server cannot produce a representation in the
            requested OOAPI or consumer version. The server may serve the
            requested version or any lower compatible minor version.

            If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is
            available, a 406 response is returned to indicate that no acceptable
            representation can be produced.

            This behaviour slightly deviates from strict HTTP semantics. Although
            no HTTP Accept header is used, the server performs an internal
            Accept-like version check after the HTTP layer, and returns 406 to
            signal that the requested representation cannot be provided.

            This approach improves clarity, implementation consistency and
            debugging, because the requested and supported versions are explicit
            in both the request and the 406 response, avoiding ambiguity caused
            by full HTTP content negotiation or Accept-based parsing.

            It also improves logging. Servers can log the requested and supported
            versions at the point of mismatch, allowing operators to detect
            outdated consumers, configuration issues or unexpected version drift.

            Allows clients to indicate which fields should be included in the response.  
            This parameter supports the principle of data minimisation and helps to optimise 
            data usage and performance by reducing unnecessary data transmission.

            The `fields` parameter uses *nested field selection syntax* with parentheses for subfields, 
            for example: `programme(code)` or `campus(city)`.  
            Multiple fields can be grouped within parentheses, for example:  
            `fields=(id,title,ectsCredits,programme(code),campus(city))`.

            When omitted, the server returns all fields the client has access to.  
            Unknown field names SHOULD be ignored.  
            The server MUST always include *mandatory fields* (e.g., identifiers such as `id`) 
            that are required for a valid or minimal response, even if not explicitly requested.

            *Important:* This is a **request hint**, not a **security feature**.  
            The server MAY disregard the request for a restricted set of fields, and the final response 
            structure MAY depend on server logic and the client’s access rights.


            If a client requests unauthorised fields, these MUST be silently omitted or redacted.

            Returned only when a specific resource identified by its identifier
            cannot be located. This applies to instance endpoints where a single,
            uniquely-addressable object is expected.  

            Collection endpoints should not return a 404. If no items match the request,
            they must return an empty array. A 404 may still occur if the collection
            endpoint itself does not exist or is not accessible.

            Returned when the server cannot produce a representation in the
            requested OOAPI or consumer version. The server may serve the
            requested version or any lower compatible minor version.

            If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is
            available, a 406 response is returned to indicate that no acceptable
            representation can be produced.

            This behaviour slightly deviates from strict HTTP semantics. Although
            no HTTP Accept header is used, the server performs an internal
            Accept-like version check after the HTTP layer, and returns 406 to
            signal that the requested representation cannot be provided.

            This approach improves clarity, implementation consistency and
            debugging, because the requested and supported versions are explicit
            in both the request and the 406 response, avoiding ambiguity caused
            by full HTTP content negotiation or Accept-based parsing.

            It also improves logging. Servers can log the requested and supported
            versions at the point of mismatch, allowing operators to detect

            This parameter supports the principle of data minimisation and helps to optimise 
            data usage and performance by reducing unnecessary data transmission.

            The `fields` parameter uses *nested field selection syntax* with parentheses for subfields, 
            for example: `programme(code)` or `campus(city)`.  
            Multiple fields can be grouped within parentheses, for example:

            When omitted, the server returns all fields the client has access to.  
            Unknown field names SHOULD be ignored.  
            The server MUST always include *mandatory fields* (e.g., identifiers such as `id`) 
            that are required for a valid or minimal response, even if not explicitly requested.

            *Important:* This is a **request hint**, not a **security feature**.  
            The server MAY disregard the request for a restricted set of fields, and the final response

            Returned only when a specific resource identified by its identifier
            cannot be located. This applies to instance endpoints where a single,
            uniquely-addressable object is expected.  

            Collection endpoints should not return a 404. If no items match the request,
            they must return an empty array. A 404 may still occur if the collection
            endpoint itself does not exist or is not accessible.

            Returned when the server cannot produce a representation in the
            requested OOAPI or consumer version. The server may serve the
            requested version or any lower compatible minor version.

            If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is
            available, a 406 response is returned to indicate that no acceptable
            representation can be produced.

            This behaviour slightly deviates from strict HTTP semantics. Although
            no HTTP Accept header is used, the server performs an internal
            Accept-like version check after the HTTP layer, and returns 406 to
            signal that the requested representation cannot be provided.

            This approach improves clarity, implementation consistency and
            debugging, because the requested and supported versions are explicit
            in both the request and the 406 response, avoiding ambiguity caused
            by full HTTP content negotiation or Accept-based parsing.

            It also improves logging. Servers can log the requested and supported
            versions at the point of mismatch, allowing operators to detect
            outdated consumers, configuration issues or unexpected version drift.

            Allows clients to indicate which fields should be included in the response.  
            This parameter supports the principle of data minimisation and helps to optimise 
            data usage and performance by reducing unnecessary data transmission.

            The `fields` parameter uses *nested field selection syntax* with parentheses for subfields, 
            for example: `programme(code)` or `campus(city)`.  
            Multiple fields can be grouped within parentheses, for example:  
            `fields=(id,title,ectsCredits,programme(code),campus(city))`.

            When omitted, the server returns all fields the client has access to.  
            Unknown field names SHOULD be ignored.  
            The server MUST always include *mandatory fields* (e.g., identifiers such as `id`) 
            that are required for a valid or minimal response, even if not explicitly requested.

            *Important:* This is a **request hint**, not a **security feature**.  
            The server MAY disregard the request for a restricted set of fields, and the final response 
            structure MAY depend on server logic and the client’s access rights.


            If a client requests unauthorised fields, these MUST be silently omitted or redacted.

            Allows clients to indicate which fields should be included in the response.  
            This parameter supports the principle of data minimisation and helps to optimise 
            data usage and performance by reducing unnecessary data transmission.

            The `fields` parameter uses *nested field selection syntax* with parentheses for subfields, 
            for example: `programme(code)` or `campus(city)`.  
            Multiple fields can be grouped within parentheses, for example:  
            `fields=(id,title,ectsCredits,programme(code),campus(city))`.

            When omitted, the server returns all fields the client has access to.  
            Unknown field names SHOULD be ignored.  
            The server MUST always include *mandatory fields* (e.g., identifiers such as `id`) 
            that are required for a valid or minimal response, even if not explicitly requested.

            *Important:* This is a **request hint**, not a **security feature**.  
            The server MAY disregard the request for a restricted set of fields, and the final response 
            structure MAY depend on server logic and the client’s access rights.


            If a client requests unauthorised fields, these MUST be silently omitted or redacted.

            Allows clients to indicate which fields should be included in the response.  
            This parameter supports the principle of data minimisation and helps to optimise 
            data usage and performance by reducing unnecessary data transmission.

            The `fields` parameter uses *nested field selection syntax* with parentheses for subfields, 
            for example: `programme(code)` or `campus(city)`.  
            Multiple fields can be grouped within parentheses, for example:  
            `fields=(id,title,ectsCredits,programme(code),campus(city))`.

            When omitted, the server returns all fields the client has access to.  
            Unknown field names SHOULD be ignored.  
            The server MUST always include *mandatory fields* (e.g., identifiers such as `id`) 
            that are required for a valid or minimal response, even if not explicitly requested.

            *Important:* This is a **request hint**, not a **security feature**.  
            The server MAY disregard the request for a restricted set of fields, and the final response 
            structure MAY depend on server logic and the client’s access rights.


            If a client requests unauthorised fields, these MUST be silently omitted or redacted.

            Returned only when a specific resource identified by its identifier
            cannot be located. This applies to instance endpoints where a single,
            uniquely-addressable object is expected.  

            Collection endpoints should not return a 404. If no items match the request,
            they must return an empty array. A 404 may still occur if the collection
            endpoint itself does not exist or is not accessible.

            Not Acceptable.

            Returned when the server cannot produce a representation in the
            requested OOAPI or consumer version. The server may serve the
            requested version or any lower compatible minor version.

            If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is
            available, a 406 response is returned to indicate that no acceptable
            representation can be produced.

            This behaviour slightly deviates from strict HTTP semantics. Although
            no HTTP Accept header is used, the server performs an internal
            Accept-like version check after the HTTP layer, and returns 406 to
            signal that the requested representation cannot be provided.

            This approach improves clarity, implementation consistency and
            debugging, because the requested and supported versions are explicit
            in both the request and the 406 response, avoiding ambiguity caused
            by full HTTP content negotiation or Accept-based parsing.

            It also improves logging. Servers can log the requested and supported
            versions at the point of mismatch, allowing operators to detect
            outdated consumers, configuration issues or unexpected version drift.

            Returned only when a specific resource identified by its identifier
            cannot be located. This applies to instance endpoints where a single,
            uniquely-addressable object is expected.  

            Collection endpoints should not return a 404. If no items match the request,
            they must return an empty array. A 404 may still occur if the collection
            endpoint itself does not exist or is not accessible.

            Returned when the server cannot produce a representation in the
            requested OOAPI or consumer version. The server may serve the
            requested version or any lower compatible minor version.

            If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is
            available, a 406 response is returned to indicate that no acceptable
            representation can be produced.

            This behaviour slightly deviates from strict HTTP semantics. Although
            no HTTP Accept header is used, the server performs an internal
            Accept-like version check after the HTTP layer, and returns 406 to
            signal that the requested representation cannot be provided.

            This approach improves clarity, implementation consistency and
            debugging, because the requested and supported versions are explicit
            in both the request and the 406 response, avoiding ambiguity caused
            by full HTTP content negotiation or Accept-based parsing.

            It also improves logging. Servers can log the requested and supported
            versions at the point of mismatch, allowing operators to detect
            outdated consumers, configuration issues or unexpected version drift.

            Allows clients to indicate which fields should be included in the response.  
            This parameter supports the principle of data minimisation and helps to optimise 
            data usage and performance by reducing unnecessary data transmission.

            The `fields` parameter uses *nested field selection syntax* with parentheses for subfields, 
            for example: `programme(code)` or `campus(city)`.  
            Multiple fields can be grouped within parentheses, for example:  
            `fields=(id,title,ectsCredits,programme(code),campus(city))`.

            When omitted, the server returns all fields the client has access to.  
            Unknown field names SHOULD be ignored.  
            The server MUST always include *mandatory fields* (e.g., identifiers such as `id`) 
            that are required for a valid or minimal response, even if not explicitly requested.

            *Important:* This is a **request hint**, not a **security feature**.  
            The server MAY disregard the request for a restricted set of fields, and the final response 
            structure MAY depend on server logic and the client’s access rights.


            If a client requests unauthorised fields, these MUST be silently omitted or redacted.

            Allows clients to indicate which fields should be included in the response.  
            This parameter supports the principle of data minimisation and helps to optimise 
            data usage and performance by reducing unnecessary data transmission.

            The `fields` parameter uses *nested field selection syntax* with parentheses for subfields, 
            for example: `programme(code)` or `campus(city)`.  
            Multiple fields can be grouped within parentheses, for example:  
            `fields=(id,title,ectsCredits,programme(code),campus(city))`.

            When omitted, the server returns all fields the client has access to.  
            Unknown field names SHOULD be ignored.  
            The server MUST always include *mandatory fields* (e.g., identifiers such as `id`) 
            that are required for a valid or minimal response, even if not explicitly requested.

            *Important:* This is a **request hint**, not a **security feature**.  
            The server MAY disregard the request for a restricted set of fields, and the final response 
            structure MAY depend on server logic and the client’s access rights.


            If a client requests unauthorised fields, these MUST be silently omitted or redacted.

            If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is

            cannot be located. This applies to instance endpoints where a single,

            Collection endpoints should not return a 404. If no items match the request,
            they must return an empty array. A 404 may still occur if the collection
            endpoint itself does not exist or is not accessible.

            Returned when the server cannot produce a representation in the
            requested OOAPI or consumer version. The server may serve the
            requested version or any lower compatible minor version.

            If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is
            available, a 406 response is returned to indicate that no acceptable
            representation can be produced.

            This behaviour slightly deviates from strict HTTP semantics. Although
            no HTTP Accept header is used, the server performs an internal
            Accept-like version check after the HTTP layer, and returns 406 to
            signal that the requested representation cannot be provided.

            This approach improves clarity, implementation consistency and
            debugging, because the requested and supported versions are explicit
            in both the request and the 406 response, avoiding ambiguity caused
            by full HTTP content negotiation or Accept-based parsing.

            It also improves logging. Servers can log the requested and supported
            versions at the point of mismatch, allowing operators to detect
            outdated consumers, configuration issues or unexpected version drift.

        Security must be implemented at the level of the actual deployment rather than in the core 
        specification. This means that the specification remains neutral, while concrete security 
        measures can be applied in practice using established techniques such as OpenID with 
        fine-grained scopes.

            The server MAY disregard the request for a restricted set of fields, and the final response

            Allows clients to indicate which fields should be included in the response.  
            This parameter supports the principle of data minimisation and helps to optimise 
            data usage and performance by reducing unnecessary data transmission.

            The `fields` parameter uses *nested field selection syntax* with parentheses for subfields, 
            for example: `programme(code)` or `campus(city)`.  
            Multiple fields can be grouped within parentheses, for example:  
            `fields=(id,title,ectsCredits,programme(code),campus(city))`.

            When omitted, the server returns all fields the client has access to.  
            Unknown field names SHOULD be ignored.  
            The server MUST always include *mandatory fields* (e.g., identifiers such as `id`) 
            that are required for a valid or minimal response, even if not explicitly requested.

            *Important:* This is a **request hint**, not a **security feature**.  
            The server MAY disregard the request for a restricted set of fields, and the final response 
            structure MAY depend on server logic and the client’s access rights.


            If a client requests unauthorised fields, these MUST be silently omitted or redacted.

            Returned only when a specific resource identified by its identifier
            cannot be located. This applies to instance endpoints where a single,
            uniquely-addressable object is expected.  

            Collection endpoints should not return a 404. If no items match the request,
            they must return an empty array. A 404 may still occur if the collection
            endpoint itself does not exist or is not accessible.

            Not Acceptable.

            Returned when the server cannot produce a representation in the
            requested OOAPI or consumer version. The server may serve the
            requested version or any lower compatible minor version.

            If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is
            available, a 406 response is returned to indicate that no acceptable
            representation can be produced.

            This behaviour slightly deviates from strict HTTP semantics. Although
            no HTTP Accept header is used, the server performs an internal
            Accept-like version check after the HTTP layer, and returns 406 to
            signal that the requested representation cannot be provided.

            This approach improves clarity, implementation consistency and
            debugging, because the requested and supported versions are explicit
            in both the request and the 406 response, avoiding ambiguity caused
            by full HTTP content negotiation or Accept-based parsing.

            It also improves logging. Servers can log the requested and supported
            versions at the point of mismatch, allowing operators to detect
            outdated consumers, configuration issues or unexpected version drift.

            Returned only when a specific resource identified by its identifier
            cannot be located. This applies to instance endpoints where a single,
            uniquely-addressable object is expected.  

            Collection endpoints should not return a 404. If no items match the request,
            they must return an empty array. A 404 may still occur if the collection
            endpoint itself does not exist or is not accessible.

            Not Acceptable.

            Returned when the server cannot produce a representation in the
            requested OOAPI or consumer version. The server may serve the
            requested version or any lower compatible minor version.

            If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is
            available, a 406 response is returned to indicate that no acceptable
            representation can be produced.

            This behaviour slightly deviates from strict HTTP semantics. Although
            no HTTP Accept header is used, the server performs an internal
            Accept-like version check after the HTTP layer, and returns 406 to
            signal that the requested representation cannot be provided.

            This approach improves clarity, implementation consistency and
            debugging, because the requested and supported versions are explicit
            in both the request and the 406 response, avoiding ambiguity caused
            by full HTTP content negotiation or Accept-based parsing.

            It also improves logging. Servers can log the requested and supported
            versions at the point of mismatch, allowing operators to detect
            outdated consumers, configuration issues or unexpected version drift.

            Allows clients to indicate which fields should be included in the response.  
            This parameter supports the principle of data minimisation and helps to optimise 
            data usage and performance by reducing unnecessary data transmission.

            The `fields` parameter uses *nested field selection syntax* with parentheses for subfields, 
            for example: `programme(code)` or `campus(city)`.  
            Multiple fields can be grouped within parentheses, for example:  
            `fields=(id,title,ectsCredits,programme(code),campus(city))`.

            When omitted, the server returns all fields the client has access to.  
            Unknown field names SHOULD be ignored.  
            The server MUST always include *mandatory fields* (e.g., identifiers such as `id`) 
            that are required for a valid or minimal response, even if not explicitly requested.

            *Important:* This is a **request hint**, not a **security feature**.  
            The server MAY disregard the request for a restricted set of fields, and the final response 
            structure MAY depend on server logic and the client’s access rights.


            If a client requests unauthorised fields, these MUST be silently omitted or redacted.

            Returned only when a specific resource identified by its identifier
            cannot be located. This applies to instance endpoints where a single,
            uniquely-addressable object is expected.  

            Collection endpoints should not return a 404. If no items match the request,
            they must return an empty array. A 404 may still occur if the collection
            endpoint itself does not exist or is not accessible.

            Returned when the server cannot produce a representation in the
            requested OOAPI or consumer version. The server may serve the
            requested version or any lower compatible minor version.

            If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is
            available, a 406 response is returned to indicate that no acceptable
            representation can be produced.

            This behaviour slightly deviates from strict HTTP semantics. Although
            no HTTP Accept header is used, the server performs an internal
            Accept-like version check after the HTTP layer, and returns 406 to
            signal that the requested representation cannot be provided.

            This approach improves clarity, implementation consistency and
            debugging, because the requested and supported versions are explicit
            in both the request and the 406 response, avoiding ambiguity caused
            by full HTTP content negotiation or Accept-based parsing.

            It also improves logging. Servers can log the requested and supported
            versions at the point of mismatch, allowing operators to detect
            outdated consumers, configuration issues or unexpected version drift.

            Allows clients to indicate which fields should be included in the response.  
            This parameter supports the principle of data minimisation and helps to optimise 
            data usage and performance by reducing unnecessary data transmission.

            The `fields` parameter uses *nested field selection syntax* with parentheses for subfields, 
            for example: `programme(code)` or `campus(city)`.  
            Multiple fields can be grouped within parentheses, for example:  
            `fields=(id,title,ectsCredits,programme(code),campus(city))`.

            When omitted, the server returns all fields the client has access to.  
            Unknown field names SHOULD be ignored.  
            The server MUST always include *mandatory fields* (e.g., identifiers such as `id`) 
            that are required for a valid or minimal response, even if not explicitly requested.

            *Important:* This is a **request hint**, not a **security feature**.  
            The server MAY disregard the request for a restricted set of fields, and the final response 
            structure MAY depend on server logic and the client’s access rights.


            If a client requests unauthorised fields, these MUST be silently omitted or redacted.

            Returned when the server cannot produce a representation in the
            requested OOAPI or consumer version. The server may serve the
            requested version or any lower compatible minor version.

            If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is
            available, a 406 response is returned to indicate that no acceptable
            representation can be produced.

            This behaviour slightly deviates from strict HTTP semantics. Although
            no HTTP Accept header is used, the server performs an internal
            Accept-like version check after the HTTP layer, and returns 406 to
            signal that the requested representation cannot be provided.

            This approach improves clarity, implementation consistency and
            debugging, because the requested and supported versions are explicit
            in both the request and the 406 response, avoiding ambiguity caused
            by full HTTP content negotiation or Accept-based parsing.

            It also improves logging. Servers can log the requested and supported
            versions at the point of mismatch, allowing operators to detect
            outdated consumers, configuration issues or unexpected version drift.

        POST a single programme offering association, enrol a person based on person information obtained from well known endpoint, an offering, 
        and the organisation/type=root information from the organisation that is issuing this association. 
        The offering can either be identified by an offeringId if known or the full offering details. 

        Security must be implemented at the level of the actual deployment rather than in the core specification. 
        This means that the specification remains neutral, while concrete security measures can be applied in 
        practice using established techniques such as OpenID with fine-grained scopes. For example, write access 
        on programme-offering associations for an external user (“me.write”) can be granted in this way. The previous 
        inline declaration has therefore been removed to avoid conflating implementation details with the specification.

            Allows clients to indicate which fields should be included in the response.  
            This parameter supports the principle of data minimisation and helps to optimise 
            data usage and performance by reducing unnecessary data transmission.

            The `fields` parameter uses *nested field selection syntax* with parentheses for subfields, 
            for example: `programme(code)` or `campus(city)`.  
            Multiple fields can be grouped within parentheses, for example:  
            `fields=(id,title,ectsCredits,programme(code),campus(city))`.

            When omitted, the server returns all fields the client has access to.  
            Unknown field names SHOULD be ignored.  
            The server MUST always include *mandatory fields* (e.g., identifiers such as `id`) 
            that are required for a valid or minimal response, even if not explicitly requested.

            *Important:* This is a **request hint**, not a **security feature**.  
            The server MAY disregard the request for a restricted set of fields, and the final response 
            structure MAY depend on server logic and the client’s access rights.


            If a client requests unauthorised fields, these MUST be silently omitted or redacted.

            Returned when the server cannot produce a representation in the
            requested OOAPI or consumer version. The server may serve the
            requested version or any lower compatible minor version.

            If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is
            available, a 406 response is returned to indicate that no acceptable
            representation can be produced.

            This behaviour slightly deviates from strict HTTP semantics. Although
            no HTTP Accept header is used, the server performs an internal
            Accept-like version check after the HTTP layer, and returns 406 to
            signal that the requested representation cannot be provided.

            This approach improves clarity, implementation consistency and
            debugging, because the requested and supported versions are explicit
            in both the request and the 406 response, avoiding ambiguity caused
            by full HTTP content negotiation or Accept-based parsing.

            It also improves logging. Servers can log the requested and supported
            versions at the point of mismatch, allowing operators to detect
            outdated consumers, configuration issues or unexpected version drift.

        Update the status or result of an enrolment. Other elements of the association object COULD 
        also be PATCHED. But are not likely and have therefore not been included in this endpoint.
        Implementation of the PATCH activity is based on use PATCH with JSON Merge Patch standard, 
        a specialized media type `application/merge-patch+json` for partial resource representation 
        to update parts of resource objects.

        Security must be implemented at the level of the actual deployment rather than in the core 
        specification. This means that the specification remains neutral, while concrete security 
        measures can be applied in practice using established techniques such as OpenID with fine-grained 
        scopes (for example, write access on associations). The previous inline declaration has therefore
        been removed to avoid conflating implementation details with the specification.

            Allows clients to indicate which fields should be included in the response.  
            This parameter supports the principle of data minimisation and helps to optimise 
            data usage and performance by reducing unnecessary data transmission.

            The `fields` parameter uses *nested field selection syntax* with parentheses for subfields, 
            for example: `programme(code)` or `campus(city)`.  
            Multiple fields can be grouped within parentheses, for example:  
            `fields=(id,title,ectsCredits,programme(code),campus(city))`.

            When omitted, the server returns all fields the client has access to.  
            Unknown field names SHOULD be ignored.  
            The server MUST always include *mandatory fields* (e.g., identifiers such as `id`) 
            that are required for a valid or minimal response, even if not explicitly requested.

            *Important:* This is a **request hint**, not a **security feature**.  
            The server MAY disregard the request for a restricted set of fields, and the final response 
            structure MAY depend on server logic and the client’s access rights.


            If a client requests unauthorised fields, these MUST be silently omitted or redacted.

            Returned only when a specific resource identified by its identifier
            cannot be located. This applies to instance endpoints where a single,
            uniquely-addressable object is expected.  

            Collection endpoints should not return a 404. If no items match the request,
            they must return an empty array. A 404 may still occur if the collection
            endpoint itself does not exist or is not accessible.

            Returned when the server cannot produce a representation in the
            requested OOAPI or consumer version. The server may serve the
            requested version or any lower compatible minor version.

            If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is
            available, a 406 response is returned to indicate that no acceptable
            representation can be produced.

            This behaviour slightly deviates from strict HTTP semantics. Although
            no HTTP Accept header is used, the server performs an internal
            Accept-like version check after the HTTP layer, and returns 406 to
            signal that the requested representation cannot be provided.

            This approach improves clarity, implementation consistency and
            debugging, because the requested and supported versions are explicit
            in both the request and the 406 response, avoiding ambiguity caused
            by full HTTP content negotiation or Accept-based parsing.

            It also improves logging. Servers can log the requested and supported
            versions at the point of mismatch, allowing operators to detect
            outdated consumers, configuration issues or unexpected version drift.

            The server MUST always include *mandatory fields* (e.g., identifiers such as `id`)

            Returned only when a specific resource identified by its identifier
            cannot be located. This applies to instance endpoints where a single,
            uniquely-addressable object is expected.  

            Collection endpoints should not return a 404. If no items match the request,
            they must return an empty array. A 404 may still occur if the collection
            endpoint itself does not exist or is not accessible.

            Not Acceptable.

            Returned when the server cannot produce a representation in the
            requested OOAPI or consumer version. The server may serve the
            requested version or any lower compatible minor version.

            If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is
            available, a 406 response is returned to indicate that no acceptable
            representation can be produced.

            This behaviour slightly deviates from strict HTTP semantics. Although
            no HTTP Accept header is used, the server performs an internal
            Accept-like version check after the HTTP layer, and returns 406 to
            signal that the requested representation cannot be provided.

            This approach improves clarity, implementation consistency and
            debugging, because the requested and supported versions are explicit
            in both the request and the 406 response, avoiding ambiguity caused
            by full HTTP content negotiation or Accept-based parsing.

            It also improves logging. Servers can log the requested and supported
            versions at the point of mismatch, allowing operators to detect
            outdated consumers, configuration issues or unexpected version drift.

            Allows clients to indicate which fields should be included in the response.  
            This parameter supports the principle of data minimisation and helps to optimise 
            data usage and performance by reducing unnecessary data transmission.

            The `fields` parameter uses *nested field selection syntax* with parentheses for subfields, 
            for example: `programme(code)` or `campus(city)`.  
            Multiple fields can be grouped within parentheses, for example:  
            `fields=(id,title,ectsCredits,programme(code),campus(city))`.

            When omitted, the server returns all fields the client has access to.  
            Unknown field names SHOULD be ignored.  
            The server MUST always include *mandatory fields* (e.g., identifiers such as `id`) 
            that are required for a valid or minimal response, even if not explicitly requested.

            *Important:* This is a **request hint**, not a **security feature**.  
            The server MAY disregard the request for a restricted set of fields, and the final response 
            structure MAY depend on server logic and the client’s access rights.


            If a client requests unauthorised fields, these MUST be silently omitted or redacted.

            This behaviour slightly deviates from strict HTTP semantics. Although
            no HTTP Accept header is used, the server performs an internal
            Accept-like version check after the HTTP layer, and returns 406 to
            signal that the requested representation cannot be provided.

            This approach improves clarity, implementation consistency and
            debugging, because the requested and supported versions are explicit
            in both the request and the 406 response, avoiding ambiguity caused
            by full HTTP content negotiation or Accept-based parsing.

            It also improves logging. Servers can log the requested and supported
            versions at the point of mismatch, allowing operators to detect
            outdated consumers, configuration issues or unexpected version drift.

            Allows clients to indicate which fields should be included in the response.  
            This parameter supports the principle of data minimisation and helps to optimise 
            data usage and performance by reducing unnecessary data transmission.

            The `fields` parameter uses *nested field selection syntax* with parentheses for subfields, 
            for example: `programme(code)` or `campus(city)`.  
            Multiple fields can be grouped within parentheses, for example:  
            `fields=(id,title,ectsCredits,programme(code),campus(city))`.

            When omitted, the server returns all fields the client has access to.  
            Unknown field names SHOULD be ignored.  
            The server MUST always include *mandatory fields* (e.g., identifiers such as `id`) 
            that are required for a valid or minimal response, even if not explicitly requested.

            *Important:* This is a **request hint**, not a **security feature**.  
            The server MAY disregard the request for a restricted set of fields, and the final response 
            structure MAY depend on server logic and the client’s access rights.


            If a client requests unauthorised fields, these MUST be silently omitted or redacted.

            If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is

            Returned only when a specific resource identified by its identifier
            cannot be located. This applies to instance endpoints where a single,
            uniquely-addressable object is expected.  

            Collection endpoints should not return a 404. If no items match the request,
            they must return an empty array. A 404 may still occur if the collection
            endpoint itself does not exist or is not accessible.

            Not Acceptable.

            Returned when the server cannot produce a representation in the
            requested OOAPI or consumer version. The server may serve the
            requested version or any lower compatible minor version.

            If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is
            available, a 406 response is returned to indicate that no acceptable
            representation can be produced.

            This behaviour slightly deviates from strict HTTP semantics. Although
            no HTTP Accept header is used, the server performs an internal
            Accept-like version check after the HTTP layer, and returns 406 to
            signal that the requested representation cannot be provided.

            This approach improves clarity, implementation consistency and
            debugging, because the requested and supported versions are explicit
            in both the request and the 406 response, avoiding ambiguity caused
            by full HTTP content negotiation or Accept-based parsing.

            It also improves logging. Servers can log the requested and supported
            versions at the point of mismatch, allowing operators to detect
            outdated consumers, configuration issues or unexpected version drift.

            Allows clients to indicate which fields should be included in the response.  
            This parameter supports the principle of data minimisation and helps to optimise 
            data usage and performance by reducing unnecessary data transmission.

            The `fields` parameter uses *nested field selection syntax* with parentheses for subfields, 
            for example: `programme(code)` or `campus(city)`.  
            Multiple fields can be grouped within parentheses, for example:  
            `fields=(id,title,ectsCredits,programme(code),campus(city))`.

            When omitted, the server returns all fields the client has access to.  
            Unknown field names SHOULD be ignored.  
            The server MUST always include *mandatory fields* (e.g., identifiers such as `id`) 
            that are required for a valid or minimal response, even if not explicitly requested.

            *Important:* This is a **request hint**, not a **security feature**.  
            The server MAY disregard the request for a restricted set of fields, and the final response 
            structure MAY depend on server logic and the client’s access rights.


            If a client requests unauthorised fields, these MUST be silently omitted or redacted.

            Returned when the server cannot produce a representation in the
            requested OOAPI or consumer version. The server may serve the
            requested version or any lower compatible minor version.

            If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is
            available, a 406 response is returned to indicate that no acceptable
            representation can be produced.

            This behaviour slightly deviates from strict HTTP semantics. Although
            no HTTP Accept header is used, the server performs an internal

            in both the request and the 406 response, avoiding ambiguity caused

            It also improves logging. Servers can log the requested and supported
            versions at the point of mismatch, allowing operators to detect
            outdated consumers, configuration issues or unexpected version drift.

            The `fields` parameter uses *nested field selection syntax* with parentheses for subfields,

            Returned only when a specific resource identified by its identifier
            cannot be located. This applies to instance endpoints where a single,
            uniquely-addressable object is expected.  

            Collection endpoints should not return a 404. If no items match the request,
            they must return an empty array. A 404 may still occur if the collection
            endpoint itself does not exist or is not accessible.

            Not Acceptable.

            Returned when the server cannot produce a representation in the
            requested OOAPI or consumer version. The server may serve the
            requested version or any lower compatible minor version.

            If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is
            available, a 406 response is returned to indicate that no acceptable
            representation can be produced.

            This behaviour slightly deviates from strict HTTP semantics. Although
            no HTTP Accept header is used, the server performs an internal
            Accept-like version check after the HTTP layer, and returns 406 to
            signal that the requested representation cannot be provided.

            This approach improves clarity, implementation consistency and
            debugging, because the requested and supported versions are explicit
            in both the request and the 406 response, avoiding ambiguity caused
            by full HTTP content negotiation or Accept-based parsing.

            It also improves logging. Servers can log the requested and supported
            versions at the point of mismatch, allowing operators to detect
            outdated consumers, configuration issues or unexpected version drift.

            Returned when the server cannot produce a representation in the
            requested OOAPI or consumer version. The server may serve the
            requested version or any lower compatible minor version.

            If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is
            available, a 406 response is returned to indicate that no acceptable
            representation can be produced.

            This behaviour slightly deviates from strict HTTP semantics. Although
            no HTTP Accept header is used, the server performs an internal
            Accept-like version check after the HTTP layer, and returns 406 to
            signal that the requested representation cannot be provided.

            This approach improves clarity, implementation consistency and
            debugging, because the requested and supported versions are explicit
            in both the request and the 406 response, avoiding ambiguity caused
            by full HTTP content negotiation or Accept-based parsing.

            It also improves logging. Servers can log the requested and supported
            versions at the point of mismatch, allowing operators to detect
            outdated consumers, configuration issues or unexpected version drift.

            Allows clients to indicate which fields should be included in the response.  
            This parameter supports the principle of data minimisation and helps to optimise 
            data usage and performance by reducing unnecessary data transmission.

            The `fields` parameter uses *nested field selection syntax* with parentheses for subfields, 
            for example: `programme(code)` or `campus(city)`.  
            Multiple fields can be grouped within parentheses, for example:  
            `fields=(id,title,ectsCredits,programme(code),campus(city))`.

            When omitted, the server returns all fields the client has access to.  
            Unknown field names SHOULD be ignored.  
            The server MUST always include *mandatory fields* (e.g., identifiers such as `id`) 
            that are required for a valid or minimal response, even if not explicitly requested.

            *Important:* This is a **request hint**, not a **security feature**.  
            The server MAY disregard the request for a restricted set of fields, and the final response 
            structure MAY depend on server logic and the client’s access rights.


            If a client requests unauthorised fields, these MUST be silently omitted or redacted.

            Not Acceptable.

            Returned when the server cannot produce a representation in the
            requested OOAPI or consumer version. The server may serve the
            requested version or any lower compatible minor version.

            If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is
            available, a 406 response is returned to indicate that no acceptable
            representation can be produced.

            This behaviour slightly deviates from strict HTTP semantics. Although
            no HTTP Accept header is used, the server performs an internal
            Accept-like version check after the HTTP layer, and returns 406 to
            signal that the requested representation cannot be provided.

            This approach improves clarity, implementation consistency and
            debugging, because the requested and supported versions are explicit
            in both the request and the 406 response, avoiding ambiguity caused
            by full HTTP content negotiation or Accept-based parsing.

            It also improves logging. Servers can log the requested and supported
            versions at the point of mismatch, allowing operators to detect
            outdated consumers, configuration issues or unexpected version drift.

      description: |
        Update the status or result of an enrolment. Other elements of the association object COULD 
        also be PATCHED. But are not likely and have therefore not been included in this endpoint.
        Implementation of the PATCH activity is based on use PATCH with JSON Merge Patch standard, 
        a specialized media type `application/merge-patch+json` for partial resource representation 
        to update parts of resource objects.

        Security must be implemented at the level of the actual deployment rather than in the core 
        specification. This means that the specification remains neutral, while concrete security 
        measures can be applied in practice using established techniques such as OpenID with fine-grained 
        scopes (for example, write access on associations). The previous inline declaration has therefore
        been removed to avoid conflating implementation details with the specification.

            Allows clients to indicate which fields should be included in the response.  
            This parameter supports the principle of data minimisation and helps to optimise 
            data usage and performance by reducing unnecessary data transmission.

            The `fields` parameter uses *nested field selection syntax* with parentheses for subfields, 
            for example: `programme(code)` or `campus(city)`.  
            Multiple fields can be grouped within parentheses, for example:  
            `fields=(id,title,ectsCredits,programme(code),campus(city))`.

            When omitted, the server returns all fields the client has access to.  
            Unknown field names SHOULD be ignored.  
            The server MUST always include *mandatory fields* (e.g., identifiers such as `id`) 
            that are required for a valid or minimal response, even if not explicitly requested.

            *Important:* This is a **request hint**, not a **security feature**.  
            The server MAY disregard the request for a restricted set of fields, and the final response 
            structure MAY depend on server logic and the client’s access rights.


            If a client requests unauthorised fields, these MUST be silently omitted or redacted.

            cannot be located. This applies to instance endpoints where a single,
            uniquely-addressable object is expected.  

            Collection endpoints should not return a 404. If no items match the request,
            they must return an empty array. A 404 may still occur if the collection
            endpoint itself does not exist or is not accessible.

            Not Acceptable.

            Returned when the server cannot produce a representation in the
            requested OOAPI or consumer version. The server may serve the
            requested version or any lower compatible minor version.

            If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is
            available, a 406 response is returned to indicate that no acceptable
            representation can be produced.

            This behaviour slightly deviates from strict HTTP semantics. Although
            no HTTP Accept header is used, the server performs an internal
            Accept-like version check after the HTTP layer, and returns 406 to
            signal that the requested representation cannot be provided.

            This approach improves clarity, implementation consistency and
            debugging, because the requested and supported versions are explicit
            in both the request and the 406 response, avoiding ambiguity caused
            by full HTTP content negotiation or Accept-based parsing.

            It also improves logging. Servers can log the requested and supported
            versions at the point of mismatch, allowing operators to detect
            outdated consumers, configuration issues or unexpected version drift.

            This parameter supports the principle of data minimisation and helps to optimise 
            data usage and performance by reducing unnecessary data transmission.

            The `fields` parameter uses *nested field selection syntax* with parentheses for subfields, 
            for example: `programme(code)` or `campus(city)`.  
            Multiple fields can be grouped within parentheses, for example:  
            `fields=(id,title,ectsCredits,programme(code),campus(city))`.

            When omitted, the server returns all fields the client has access to.  
            Unknown field names SHOULD be ignored.  
            The server MUST always include *mandatory fields* (e.g., identifiers such as `id`) 
            that are required for a valid or minimal response, even if not explicitly requested.

            *Important:* This is a **request hint**, not a **security feature**.  
            The server MAY disregard the request for a restricted set of fields, and the final response 
            structure MAY depend on server logic and the client’s access rights.


            If a client requests unauthorised fields, these MUST be silently omitted or redacted.

            It also improves logging. Servers can log the requested and supported
            versions at the point of mismatch, allowing operators to detect
            outdated consumers, configuration issues or unexpected version drift.

            Returned when the server cannot produce a representation in the
            requested OOAPI or consumer version. The server may serve the
            requested version or any lower compatible minor version.

            If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is

            This behaviour slightly deviates from strict HTTP semantics. Although
            no HTTP Accept header is used, the server performs an internal

            Allows clients to indicate which fields should be included in the response.  
            This parameter supports the principle of data minimisation and helps to optimise 
            data usage and performance by reducing unnecessary data transmission.

            The `fields` parameter uses *nested field selection syntax* with parentheses for subfields, 
            for example: `programme(code)` or `campus(city)`.  
            Multiple fields can be grouped within parentheses, for example:  
            `fields=(id,title,ectsCredits,programme(code),campus(city))`.

            When omitted, the server returns all fields the client has access to.  
            Unknown field names SHOULD be ignored.  
            The server MUST always include *mandatory fields* (e.g., identifiers such as `id`) 
            that are required for a valid or minimal response, even if not explicitly requested.

            *Important:* This is a **request hint**, not a **security feature**.  
            The server MAY disregard the request for a restricted set of fields, and the final response 
            structure MAY depend on server logic and the client’s access rights.


            If a client requests unauthorised fields, these MUST be silently omitted or redacted.

            Allows clients to indicate which fields should be included in the response.  
            This parameter supports the principle of data minimisation and helps to optimise 
            data usage and performance by reducing unnecessary data transmission.

            The `fields` parameter uses *nested field selection syntax* with parentheses for subfields, 
            for example: `programme(code)` or `campus(city)`.  
            Multiple fields can be grouped within parentheses, for example:  
            `fields=(id,title,ectsCredits,programme(code),campus(city))`.

            When omitted, the server returns all fields the client has access to.  
            Unknown field names SHOULD be ignored.  
            The server MUST always include *mandatory fields* (e.g., identifiers such as `id`) 
            that are required for a valid or minimal response, even if not explicitly requested.

            *Important:* This is a **request hint**, not a **security feature**.  
            The server MAY disregard the request for a restricted set of fields, and the final response 
            structure MAY depend on server logic and the client’s access rights.


            If a client requests unauthorised fields, these MUST be silently omitted or redacted.

            Returned only when a specific resource identified by its identifier
            cannot be located. This applies to instance endpoints where a single,
            uniquely-addressable object is expected.  

            Collection endpoints should not return a 404. If no items match the request,
            they must return an empty array. A 404 may still occur if the collection
            endpoint itself does not exist or is not accessible.

            Not Acceptable.

            Returned when the server cannot produce a representation in the
            requested OOAPI or consumer version. The server may serve the
            requested version or any lower compatible minor version.

            If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is
            available, a 406 response is returned to indicate that no acceptable
            representation can be produced.

            This behaviour slightly deviates from strict HTTP semantics. Although
            no HTTP Accept header is used, the server performs an internal
            Accept-like version check after the HTTP layer, and returns 406 to
            signal that the requested representation cannot be provided.

            This approach improves clarity, implementation consistency and
            debugging, because the requested and supported versions are explicit
            in both the request and the 406 response, avoiding ambiguity caused
            by full HTTP content negotiation or Accept-based parsing.

            It also improves logging. Servers can log the requested and supported
            versions at the point of mismatch, allowing operators to detect
            outdated consumers, configuration issues or unexpected version drift.

            Allows clients to indicate which fields should be included in the response.  
            This parameter supports the principle of data minimisation and helps to optimise 
            data usage and performance by reducing unnecessary data transmission.

            The `fields` parameter uses *nested field selection syntax* with parentheses for subfields, 
            for example: `programme(code)` or `campus(city)`.  
            Multiple fields can be grouped within parentheses, for example:  
            `fields=(id,title,ectsCredits,programme(code),campus(city))`.

            When omitted, the server returns all fields the client has access to.  
            Unknown field names SHOULD be ignored.  
            The server MUST always include *mandatory fields* (e.g., identifiers such as `id`) 
            that are required for a valid or minimal response, even if not explicitly requested.

            *Important:* This is a **request hint**, not a **security feature**.  
            The server MAY disregard the request for a restricted set of fields, and the final response 
            structure MAY depend on server logic and the client’s access rights.


            If a client requests unauthorised fields, these MUST be silently omitted or redacted.

            Allows clients to indicate which fields should be included in the response.  
            This parameter supports the principle of data minimisation and helps to optimise 
            data usage and performance by reducing unnecessary data transmission.

            The `fields` parameter uses *nested field selection syntax* with parentheses for subfields, 
            for example: `programme(code)` or `campus(city)`.  
            Multiple fields can be grouped within parentheses, for example:  
            `fields=(id,title,ectsCredits,programme(code),campus(city))`.

            When omitted, the server returns all fields the client has access to.  
            Unknown field names SHOULD be ignored.  
            The server MUST always include *mandatory fields* (e.g., identifiers such as `id`) 
            that are required for a valid or minimal response, even if not explicitly requested.

            *Important:* This is a **request hint**, not a **security feature**.  
            The server MAY disregard the request for a restricted set of fields, and the final response 
            structure MAY depend on server logic and the client’s access rights.


            If a client requests unauthorised fields, these MUST be silently omitted or redacted.

            cannot be located. This applies to instance endpoints where a single,
            uniquely-addressable object is expected.  

            Collection endpoints should not return a 404. If no items match the request,
            they must return an empty array. A 404 may still occur if the collection
            endpoint itself does not exist or is not accessible.

        '406':

            Not Acceptable.

            Returned when the server cannot produce a representation in the
            requested OOAPI or consumer version. The server may serve the
            requested version or any lower compatible minor version.

            If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is
            available, a 406 response is returned to indicate that no acceptable
            representation can be produced.

            This behaviour slightly deviates from strict HTTP semantics. Although
            no HTTP Accept header is used, the server performs an internal
            Accept-like version check after the HTTP layer, and returns 406 to
            signal that the requested representation cannot be provided.

            This approach improves clarity, implementation consistency and
            debugging, because the requested and supported versions are explicit
            in both the request and the 406 response, avoiding ambiguity caused
            by full HTTP content negotiation or Accept-based parsing.

            It also improves logging. Servers can log the requested and supported
            versions at the point of mismatch, allowing operators to detect
            outdated consumers, configuration issues or unexpected version drift.

    Language:
      description: |
        The language used in the described entity. A string formatted according to RFC 4647 https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4647.html
        RFC 4647 supports language specifications from very general to very specific. 
        This breaks down as:
        - ([a-z]{2,3}) - Primary language subtag (2-3 letters) ISO 639-1, ISO 639-2, or ISO 639-3 https://www.iso.org/iso-639-language-code
        - (-([A-Z]{2}|[0-9]{3}))? - Optional region/country (2 uppercase letters or 3 digits) ISO 3166-1 or UN M.49 https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html
        - (-([a-z]{4}))? - Optional script subtag (4 lowercase letters)
        - (-([a-z]{2}|[0-9]{3}))* - Optional variant subtags
        - (-[a-z0-9]{2,8})* - Optional extension subtags
        - (-x(-[a-z0-9]{1,8})+)? - Optional private use extensions

        When using this schema, the most common format is a two-letter language code as specified by ISO 639-1, optionally followed by a dash and a two-letter country code as specified by ISO 3166-1 (e.g. "en" or "en-GB").
        More specific language tags are also allowed, such as "zh-Hant-TW" for Traditional Chinese as used in Taiwan.
        For sign language based on a certain language two methods are commonly used: either using the subtag "sgn" (e.g. "nl-sgn-NL" for Dutch Sign Language) or using the subtag "s" (e.g. "nl-s-NL" for Dutch Sign Language). Both methods are allowed.

        Returned only when a specific resource identified by its identifier
        cannot be located. This applies to instance endpoints where a single,
        uniquely-addressable object is expected.  

        Collection endpoints should not return a 404. If no items match the request,
        they must return an empty array. A 404 may still occur if the collection
        endpoint itself does not exist or is not accessible.

        Not Acceptable.

        Returned when the server cannot produce a representation in the
        requested OOAPI or consumer version. The server may serve the
        requested version or any lower compatible minor version.

        If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is
        available, a 406 response is returned to indicate that no acceptable
        representation can be produced.

        This behaviour slightly deviates from strict HTTP semantics. Although
        no HTTP Accept header is used, the server performs an internal
        Accept-like version check after the HTTP layer, and returns 406 to
        signal that the requested representation cannot be provided.

        This approach improves clarity, implementation consistency and
        debugging, because the requested and supported versions are explicit
        in both the request and the 406 response, avoiding ambiguity caused
        by full HTTP content negotiation or Accept-based parsing.

        It also improves logging. Servers can log the requested and supported
        versions at the point of mismatch, allowing operators to detect
        outdated consumers, configuration issues or unexpected version drift.

        Wildcards:
        - Prefer using only the asterisk `*` as a wildcard for partial matches (e.g., like and not_like).

        Implementation note:
        - The availability and behaviour of this query functionality are entirely determined by the organisation hosting
          the API implementation. It is not mandatory for implementers to support this functionality, and it cannot be enforced 
          upon organisations that provide or consume OOAPI endpoints.
        - It is up to each implementer to decide whether to support this feature. It is **not** a requirement of the OOAPI 
          standard itself.
        - Consumers or working groups that wish to apply specific filtering mechanisms are encouraged to do so using 
          this approach for the sake of consistency across implementations.

        Examples:  
        - **Filter course offerings by programme, delivery, language and start date**

        Allows clients to indicate which fields should be included in the response.  
        This parameter supports the principle of data minimisation and helps to optimise 
        data usage and performance by reducing unnecessary data transmission.

        The `fields` parameter uses *nested field selection syntax* with parentheses for subfields, 
        for example: `programme(code)` or `campus(city)`.  
        Multiple fields can be grouped within parentheses, for example:  
        `fields=(id,title,ectsCredits,programme(code),campus(city))`.

        When omitted, the server returns all fields the client has access to.  
        Unknown field names SHOULD be ignored.  
        The server MUST always include *mandatory fields* (e.g., identifiers such as `id`) 
        that are required for a valid or minimal response, even if not explicitly requested.

        *Important:* This is a **request hint**, not a **security feature**.  
        The server MAY disregard the request for a restricted set of fields, and the final response 
        structure MAY depend on server logic and the client’s access rights.


        If a client requests unauthorised fields, these MUST be silently omitted or redacted.
