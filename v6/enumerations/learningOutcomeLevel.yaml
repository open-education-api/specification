  The level of the learning outcome, based on the SOLO taxonomy (www.johnbiggs.com.au):

  - 1: Unistructural, the student can identify or carry out simple procedures; understanding is limited to a single relevant aspect
  - 2: Multistructural, the student can address several relevant aspects, but sees them as unrelated; knowledge is additive
  - 3: Relational, the student integrates several aspects into a coherent whole, demonstrating deeper understanding of relationships
  - 4: Extended abstract, the student generalises and applies learning to new domains, demonstrating theoretical and abstract thinking

  This is an *extensible enumeration*. Use the prefix `x-` for custom values.
