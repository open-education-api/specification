  Presence check or special value for filter operations.

  Implementation note:
  - The availability and behaviour of this query functionality are entirely determined by the organisation hosting
    the API implementation. It is not mandatory for all implementers to support this functionality, and it cannot be
    enforced upon organisations that consume OOAPI endpoints as clients.
  - It is up to each implementer to decide whether to support this feature. It is **not** a requirement of the OOAPI 
    standard itself.
  - Consumers or working groups that wish to apply specific filtering mechanisms are encouraged to do so using 
    this approach for the sake of consistency across implementations.
