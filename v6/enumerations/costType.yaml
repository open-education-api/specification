  The type of the cost. This is an *extensible enumeration*.

  The following values have been defined in the specification:
    - `STAP eligible`: the costs that a student can get STAP subsidy for
    - `total costs`: the total costs that a student is to pay to follow this offering
  
  Implementations are allowed to add additional values to those above, as long as they do not overlap in definition to existing values.
example: total costs
x-ooapi-extensible-enum:
  - STAP eligible
  - total costs
