      A code for a country that no longer exists is listed on ISO 3166-3 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-3).
      Implementations should refrain from using the original ISO 3166-1 code for such a country since country codes
      can be reassigned to new countries once the original country code is officially declared obsolete.
    example: ANHH
