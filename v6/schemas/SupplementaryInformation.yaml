    A supplementary content item consists of a technical media form (`type`),
    a semantic purpose (`role`), and an array of `value` entries. Together these
    fields define both how the content MUST be interpreted (`type`) and why it
    is provided (`role`).

    The `type` specifies the underlying media form (text, image, video or http)
    and determines how each `value` item MUST be handled. The `role` describes
    the intent or purpose of the supplementary item (for example announcement,
    badge, marketing or promotional teaser) and MUST NOT duplicate or encode
    the media form defined by `type`.

    The separation between `type` and `role` ensures that the same media form
    can serve multiple purposes, and that the semantic meaning remains
    independent from the technical representation of the content. The `value`
    array contains one or more language-typed strings, allowing the same content
    item to be expressed in multiple languages or alternative textual variants.
