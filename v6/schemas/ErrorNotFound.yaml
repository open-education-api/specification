  Not Found.  
  
  Returned only when a specific resource identified by its identifier
  cannot be located. This applies to instance endpoints where a single,
  uniquely-addressable object is expected.  
  
  Collection endpoints should not return a 404. If no items match the request,
  they must return an empty array. A 404 may still occur if the collection
  endpoint itself does not exist or is not accessible.
