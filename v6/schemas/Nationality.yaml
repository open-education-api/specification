      A nationality code for a country that no longer exists on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-3
      It is not adviced to use the original iso3166-1 for such a country since country codes
      can get reassigned to new countries ones the original country code is officially obsolete. It is possible
      that a person has a nationality of a country that does not exist anymore (after a country got split up like CZ and YU)\
      and never applied for nationality of one of the new countries.
    example: ANHH
