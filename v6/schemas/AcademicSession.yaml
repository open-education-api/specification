    description: |
      The identifier of the parent academicSession for this session (e.g. Autumn
      term 20xx where the current session is week 40).
      When the client does not request expansion of `parent`, only this
      identifier is returned.

      The expanded parent academicSession object of this session (e.g. Autumn
      term 20xx where the current session is week 40).
      When the client requests expansion of `parent`, the full expanded
      academicSession object MUST be returned here instead of only the identifier.
      If no parent is defined, this value is `null`.

      Although `childIds` and `children` (for example `organisationIds` versus `organisations`) may 
      seem unusual, this naming is intentional and follows the singular–plural convention defined 
      by the specification.
