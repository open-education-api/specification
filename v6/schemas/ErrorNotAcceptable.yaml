  Not Acceptable.

  Returned when the server cannot produce a representation in the
  requested OOAPI or consumer version. The server may serve the
  requested version or any lower compatible minor version.

  If neither the requested version nor a lower minor version is
  available, a 406 response is returned to indicate that no acceptable
  representation can be produced.

  This behaviour slightly deviates from strict HTTP semantics. Although
  no HTTP Accept header is used, the server performs an internal
  Accept-like version check after the HTTP layer, and returns 406 to
  signal that the requested representation cannot be provided.

  This approach improves clarity, implementation consistency and
  debugging, because the requested and supported versions are explicit
  in both the request and the 406 response, avoiding ambiguity caused
  by full HTTP content negotiation or Accept-based parsing.

  It also improves logging. Servers can log the requested and supported
  versions at the point of mismatch, allowing operators to detect
  outdated consumers, configuration issues or unexpected version drift.
